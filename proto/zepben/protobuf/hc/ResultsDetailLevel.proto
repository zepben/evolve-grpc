  * Specifies a level of detail in the results.
  *  - STANDARD: The default level. Contains information on overloaded parts of the network, peak import and export,
  *              and overall network utilisation.
  *  - BASIC: A level below STANDARD. Contains only minimal information on overloaded network parts, net energy flow,
  *           peak active/apparent power, and gross generated/delivered energy.
  *  - EXTENDED: Contains all information from BASIC and STANDARD combined. Enables overload report processing.
  *  - RAW: The most verbose detail level. Does the same as EXTENDED but also enables the results processor to
  *         populate separate database tables that contain the raw results.
