name: DistanceRelay
description: A protective device used in power systems that measures the impedance of a transmission line to determine the distance to a fault, and initiates circuit
  breaker tripping to isolate the faulty section and safeguard the power system.
attributes:
- name: backwardBlind
  type: Float
  description: The reverse blind impedance (in ohms) that defines the area to be blinded in the opposite direction of the power flow.
- name: backwardReach
  type: Float
  description: The reverse reach impedance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite direction of
    power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
- name: backwardReactance
  type: Float
  description: The reverse reactance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite direction of
    power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
- name: forwardBlind
  type: Float
  description: The forward blind impedance (in ohms) that defines the area to be blinded in the opposite direction of the power flow.
- name: forwardReach
  type: Float
  description: The forward reach impedance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite direction of
    power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
- name: forwardReactance
  type: Float
  description: The forward reactance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line in the opposite direction of
    power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
- name: operationPhaseAngle1
  type: Float
  description: The phase angle (in degrees) between voltage and current during normal operating conditions for zone 1 relay.
- name: operationPhaseAngle2
  type: Float
  description: The phase angle (in degrees) between voltage and current during normal operating conditions for zone 2 relay.
- name: operationPhaseAngle3
  type: Float
  description: The phase angle (in degrees) between voltage and current during normal operating conditions for zone 3 relay.
