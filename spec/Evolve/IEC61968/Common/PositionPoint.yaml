name: PositionPoint
description: Set of spatial coordinates that determine a point, defined in the coordinate system specified in 'Location.CoordinateSystem'.
  Use a single position point instance to describe a point-oriented location. Use a sequence of position points to describe
  a line-oriented object (physical location of non-point oriented objects like cables or lines), or area of an object (like
  a substation or a geographical zone - in this case, have first and last position point with the same values).
