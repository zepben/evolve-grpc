name: OpenCircuitTest
description: Open-circuit test results verify winding turn ratios and phase shifts. They include induced voltage and phase
  shift measurements on open-circuit windings, with voltage applied to the energised end. For three-phase windings, the excitation
  can be a positive sequence (the default) or a zero sequence.

  description: Voltage applied to the winding (end) during test.
- name: openEndVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Voltage measured at the open-circuited end, with the energised end set to rated voltage and all other ends
    open.
