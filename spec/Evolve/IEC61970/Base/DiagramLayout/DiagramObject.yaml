name: DiagramObject
description: An object that defines one or more points in a given space. This object can be associated with anything that
  specializes IdentifiedObject. For single line diagrams such objects typically include such items as analog values, breakers,
  disconnectors, power transformers, and transmission lines.
attributes:
- name: rotation
  type: AngleDegrees
  description: |-
    Sets the angle of rotation of the diagram object.  Zero degrees is pointing to the top of the diagram.  Rotation is clockwise.  DiagramObject.rotation=0 has the following meaning: The connection point of an element which has one terminal is pointing to the top side of the diagram. The connection point "From side" of an element which has more than one terminal is pointing to the top side of the diagram.
    DiagramObject.rotation=90 has the following meaning: The connection point of an element which has one terminal is pointing to the right hand side of the diagram. The connection point "From side" of an element which has more than one terminal is pointing to the right hand side of the diagram.
