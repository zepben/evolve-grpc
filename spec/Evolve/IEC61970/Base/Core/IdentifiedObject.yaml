name: IdentifiedObject
description: This is a root class to provide common identification for all classes needing identification and naming attributes.
attributes:
- name: mRID
  type: String
  description: |-
    Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID, as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID. The use of UUID is strongly recommended.
    For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
- name: name
  type: String
  description: The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique text naming the object.
- name: description
  type: String
  description: The description is a free human readable text describing or naming the object. It may be non unique and may
    not correlate to a naming hierarchy.
