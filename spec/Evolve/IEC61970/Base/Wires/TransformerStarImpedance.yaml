name: TransformerStarImpedance
description: |-
  Transformer star impedance (Pi-model) that accurately reflects impedance for transformers with 2 or 3 windings. For transformers with 4 or more windings, TransformerMeshImpedance class shall be used.
  For transmission networks use PowerTransformerEnd impedances (r, r0, x, x0, b, b0, g and g0).
