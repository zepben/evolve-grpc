name: TransformerStarImpedance
description: |-
  Transformer star impedance (Pi-model) that accurately reflects impedance for transformers with 2 or 3 windings. For transformers with 4 or more windings, TransformerMeshImpedance class shall be used.
  For transmission networks use PowerTransformerEnd impedances (r, r0, x, x0, b, b0, g and g0).

  targetDescription: (accurate for 2- or 3-winding transformers only) Pi-model impedances of this transformer end. By convention,
    for a two winding transformer, the full values of the transformer should be entered on the high voltage end (endNumber=1).
