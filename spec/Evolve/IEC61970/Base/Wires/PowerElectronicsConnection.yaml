name: PowerElectronicsConnection
description: A connection to the AC network for energy production or consumption that uses power electronics rather than rotating
  machines.
attributes:
- name: maxQ
  type: ReactivePower
  description: Maximum reactive power limit. This is the maximum (nameplate) limit for the unit.
- name: minQ
  type: ReactivePower
  description: Minimum reactive power limit for the unit. This is the minimum (nameplate) limit for the unit.
- name: ratedS
  type: ApparentPower
  description: |-
    Nameplate apparent power rating for the unit.
    The attribute shall have a positive value.
- name: ratedU
  type: Voltage
  description: |-
    Rated voltage (nameplate data, Ur in IEC 60909-0). It is primarily used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
