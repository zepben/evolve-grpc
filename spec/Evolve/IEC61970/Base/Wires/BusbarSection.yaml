name: BusbarSection
description: "A conductor, or group of conductors, with negligible impedance, that serve to connect other conducting equipment\
  \ within a single substation. \nVoltage measurements are typically obtained from voltage transformers that are connected\
  \ to busbar sections. A bus bar section may have many physical terminals but for analysis is modelled with exactly one logical\
  \ terminal."
attributes:
- name: ipMax
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: "Maximum allowable peak short-circuit current of busbar (Ipmax in IEC 60909-0). \nMechanical limit of the busbar\
    \ in the substation itself. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909."
