name: DistributedResourceActualEvent
description: A demand response event is created when there is a need to call upon resources to respond to demand adjustment
  requests. These events are created by ISO/RTO system operations and managed  by a demand response management system (DRMS).
  These events may or may not be coordinated with the Market Events and a defined Energy Market. The event will call for the
  deployment of a number of registered resources, or for deployment of resources within a zone (an organizational area within
  the power system that contains a number of resources).
