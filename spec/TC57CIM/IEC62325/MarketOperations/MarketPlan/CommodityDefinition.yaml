name: CommodityDefinition
description: Commodities in the context of IEC 62325 are MarketProducts (energy, regulation, reserve, etc) traded at a specific
  location, which in this case is a Pnode (either a specific pricing node or a pricing area or zone defined as a collection
  of pricing nodes).  The CommodityDefinition is a container for these two parameters, plus the unit of measure and the currency
  in which the Commodity is traded.  Each CommodityDefinition should be relatively static; defined once and rarely changed.
