description: Provides the Market results for the constraint processing for either the DAM or RTM. The data includes the constraint
  type (binding or violated), the solved value for the constraint, and the associated shadow price.
attributes:
- name: baseFlow
  type: Float
  description: Branch base Power Flow.
- name: BGLimit
  type: Float
  description: This value is determined in DA and RTM. The SCUC optimization ensures that the MW flow on the Branch Group
    will not exceed this limit in the relevant direction.
- name: BGTRResCap
  type: Float
  description: Branch Group TR Reservation Capacity - This value is determined in DA and RTM. It is the amount of spare transmission
    capacity that is left for the TR holder to use.
