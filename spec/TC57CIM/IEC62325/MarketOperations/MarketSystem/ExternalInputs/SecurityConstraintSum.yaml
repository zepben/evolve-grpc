description: "Typically provided by RTO systems, constraints identified in both base case and critical contingency cases have\
  \ to be transferred.\nA constraint has N (&gt;=1) constraint terms. A term is represented by an instance of TerminalConstraintTerm.\
  \ \nThe constraint expression is:\nminValue &lt;= c1*x1 + c2*x2 + .... cn*xn + k &lt;= maxValue\nwhere:\n- cn is ConstraintTerm.factor\
  \ \n- xn is the flow at the terminal\nFlow into the associated equipment is positive for the purpose of ConnectivityNode\
  \ NodeConstraintTerm.\n\nk is SecurityConstraintsLinear.resourceMW.\nThe units of k are assumed to be same as the units\
  \ of the flows, xn.  The constants, cn, are dimensionless.\nWith these conventions, cn and k are all positive for a typical\
  \ constraint such as \"weighted sum of generation shall be less than limit\". Furthermore, cn are all 1.0 for a case such\
  \ as \"interface flow shall be less than limit\", assuming the terminals are chosen on the importing side of the interface."
