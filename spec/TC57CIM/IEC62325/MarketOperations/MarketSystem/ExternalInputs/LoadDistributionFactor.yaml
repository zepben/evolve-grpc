name: LoadDistributionFactor
description: |-
  This class models the load distribution factors. This class should be used in one of two ways:

  Use it along with the AggregatedPnode and the IndividualPnode to show the distriubtion of each individual party

  OR

  Use it with Mkt_EnergyConsumer to represent the current MW/Mvar distribution within it's parnet load group.
