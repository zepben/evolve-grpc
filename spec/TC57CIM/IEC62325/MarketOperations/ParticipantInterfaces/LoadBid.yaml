name: LoadBid
description: Offer to supply energy/ancillary services from a load resource (participating load reduces consumption).
attributes:
- name: dropRampRate
  type: ActivePowerChangeRate
  description: Maximum rate that load can be reduced (MW/minute)
- name: loadRedInitiationCost
  type: Money
  description: load reduction initiation cost
- name: loadRedInitiationTime
  type: Float
  description: load reduction initiation time
- name: marketDate
  type: DateTime
  description: The date represents the NextMarketDate for which the load response bids apply to.
- name: meteredValue
  type: Boolean
  description: |-
    Flag indicated that the load reduction is metered. (See above)
    If priceSetting and meteredValue both equal 1, then the facility is eligible to set LMP in the real time market.
- name: minLoad
  type: ActivePower
  description: Minimum MW load below which it may not be reduced.
- name: minLoadReduction
  type: ActivePower
  description: Minimum MW for a load reduction (e.g. MW rating of a discrete pump.
- name: minLoadReductionCost
  type: Money
  description: Cost in $ at the minimum reduced load
- name: minLoadReductionInterval
  type: Float
  description: Shortest period load reduction shall be maintained before load can be restored to normal levels.
- name: minTimeBetLoadRed
  type: Float
  description: Shortest time that load shall be left at normal levels before a new load reduction.
- name: pickUpRampRate
  type: ActivePowerChangeRate
  description: Maximum rate load may be restored (MW/minute)
- name: priceSetting
  type: Boolean
  description: Flag to indicate that the facility can set LMP Works in tandem with Metered Value.  Greater chance of this
    being dynamic than the Metered Value, however, it is requested that Price Setting and Metered Value stay at the same source.  Currently
    no customers have implemented the metering capability, but if this option is implemented, then Price Setting could become
    dynamic.  However, Metered Value will remain static.
- name: reqNoticeTime
  type: Float
  description: Time period that is required from an order to reduce a load to the time that it takes to get to the minimum
    load reduction.
- name: shutdownCost
  type: Money
  description: The fixed cost associated with committing a load reduction.
