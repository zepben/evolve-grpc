  Congestion Revenue Rights (CRR) class that is inherited from a Document class.

  A CRR is a financial concept that is used to hedge congestion charges.

  The CRR is usually settled based on the Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) that are calculated in the day-ahead market. These LMPs are determined by the Day-ahead resource schedules/bids. CRRs will not hedge against marginal losses. If the congestion component of LMP at the sink is greater than at the source, then the CRR owner is entitled to receive a portion of congestion revenues. If the congestion component at the sink is less than at the source, then an obligation-type CRR owner will be charged, but an option-type CRR owner will not.
