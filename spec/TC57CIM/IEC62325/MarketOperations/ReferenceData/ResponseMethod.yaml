name: ResponseMethod
description: Specifies a category of energy usage that the demand response applies for; e.g. energy from lighting, HVAC, other.
attributes:
- name: activePower
  type: Float
  description: The active power value for the demand adjustment type. This supports requests to be made to a resource for
    some amount of active power provided by a particular response method, as specified by the method attribute (e.g. lighting,
    HVAC, wall mounted air conditioners, etc.).
- name: activePowerUOM
  type: String
  description: The unit of measure of active power, e.g. kiloWatts (kW), megaWatts (mW), etc.
- name: method
  type: String
  description: The response method (e.g. lighting, HVAC, wall mounted air conditioners, etc.).
- name: siteMultiplier
  type: Integer
  description: This value provides for scaling of a response method's active power. For example, a response method of air
    conditioning could utilize a small amount of active power from each air conditioning unit (e.g. 0.1 kiloWatt), but the
    site multiplier could be used to produce a the total active power adjustment by multiplying the response method active
    power by this value (e.g. a building with 100 window air conditioning  units, so 100 * 0.1 kW = 10 kW).
