- name: rucGrossSettlement
  type: YesNo
  description: Metered Sub-System (MSS) Load Following may select Net vs. Gross settlement.  Net Settlement requires the net
    Demand settled at the Metered Sub-Sustem (MSS) Load Aggregation Point (LAP) and Net Supply needs to settle at the equivalent
    to the weighted average price of the MSS generation.  Gross load will be settled at the System LAP and the Gross supply
    will be settled at the LMP.  MSS Aggregation that elects gross settlement shall have to identify if its resources are
    Load Following or not.
