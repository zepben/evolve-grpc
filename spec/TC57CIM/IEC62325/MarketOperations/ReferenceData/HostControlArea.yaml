name: HostControlArea
description: A HostControlArea has a set of tie points and a set of generator controls (i.e., AGC). It also has a total load,
  including transmission and distribution losses.
attributes:
- name: areaControlMode
  type: AreaControlMode
  description: 'The area''s present control mode: (CF = constant frequency) or (CTL = constant tie-line) or (TLB = tie-line
    bias) or (OFF = off control)'
- name: freqSetPoint
  type: Frequency
  description: The present power system frequency set point for automatic generation control
- name: frequencyBiasFactor
  type: Float
  description: The control area's frequency bias factor, in MW/0.1 Hz, for automatic generation control (AGC)
