name: SubControlArea
description: An area defined for the purpose of tracking interchange with surrounding areas via tie points; may or may not
  serve as a control area.
attributes:
- name: areaShortName
  type: String
  description: Market area short name, which is the regulation zone. It references AGC regulation zone name.
- name: constantCoefficient
  type: Float
  description: Loss estimate constant coefficient
