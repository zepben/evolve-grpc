  Model of a load that is registered to participate in the market.

  RegisteredLoad is used to model any load that is served by the wholesale market directly. RegisteredLoads may be dispatchable or non-dispatchable and may or may not have bid curves. Examples of RegisteredLoads would include: distribution company load, energy retailer load, large bulk power system connected facility load.

  Loads that are served indirectly, for example - through an energy retailer or a vertical utility, should be modeled as RegisteredDistributedResources. Examples of RegisteredDistributedResources would include: distribution level storage, distribution level generation and distribution level demand response.
