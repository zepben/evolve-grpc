name: PnodeDistributionFactor
description: This class allows SC to input different distribution factors for pricing node.
attributes:
- name: factor
  type: Float
  description: Used to calculate "participation" of Pnode in an AggregatePnode. For example, for regulation region this factor
    is 1 and total sum of all factors for a specific regulation region does not have to be 1. For pricing zone the total sum
    of all factors has to be 1.
- name: offPeak
  type: YesNo
  description: Indication that this distribution factor is to apply during off peak.
- name: onPeak
  type: YesNo
  description: Indication that this factor is to apply during Peak periods.
- name: podLossFactor
  type: Float
  description: Point of delivery loss factor
