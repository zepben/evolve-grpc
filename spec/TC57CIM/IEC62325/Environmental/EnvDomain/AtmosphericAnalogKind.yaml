description: Kinds of analogs (floats)  measuring an atmospheric condition.
attributes:
- name: albedo
- name: ambientTemperature
  description: The temperature measured b<font color="#0f0f0f">y a thermometer exposed to the air in a place sheltered from
    direct solar radiation. </font>Also known as "dry bulb" because<font color="#0f0f0f"> the air temperature is indicated
    by a thermometer not affecte</font>d by the moisture of the air.
- name: atmosphericPressure
- name: ceiling
- name: dewPoint
  description: The temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure and constant water-vapor content in order
    for saturation to occur. In other words, it is the temperature at which water vapor starts to condense out of the air.
- name: heatIndex
  description: The temperature of how hot it "feels like" for a given combination of warm air temperature and relative humidity.

- name: windChill
  description: The temperature of how cold it "feels like" based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by the
    effects of wind and cold temperatures.
- name: windSpeedGust
  description: "Maximum instantaneous wind speed in the 10 minute period preceding a moment in time so long as more than 10\
    \ knots of difference has been exhibited between peaks and lulls during that 10 minute time period. \n0 value means no\
    \ gusts during preceding 10 minute period."
- name: windSpeedInstantaneous
  description: Wind speed at a moment in time.
- name: windSpeedPeak
  description: "Peak instantaneous wind speed in the 60 minutes preceding a moment in time as long as peak speed greater than\
    \ 25 knots.  \n0 value means speed did not exceed 25 knots during preceding 60 minutes."
- name: windSpeedSustained
  description: Average instantaneous wind speed over the 2-minute time period preceding a moment in time.
