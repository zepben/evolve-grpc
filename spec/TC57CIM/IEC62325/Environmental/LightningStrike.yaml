name: LightningStrike
description: A cloud-to-ground lightning strike at a particular location.
attributes:
- name: errorEllipseConfidence
  type: PerCent
  description: Likelihood that strike fell within errorEllipse.
- name: errorEllipseMajorSemiAxis
  type: Length
  description: Length of major semi-axis (longest radius) of the error ellipse.
- name: errorEllipseMinorSemiAxis
  type: Length
  description: Length of minor semi-axis (shortest radius) of the error ellipse.
- name: errorEllipseOrientation
  type: Bearing
  description: The orientation of the major semi- axis in degrees from True North.
- name: negativePolarity
  type: Boolean
  description: The polarity of the strike, with T meaning negative. About 90% of all lightning strokes are negative strokes,
    meaning that they were initiated by a large concentration of negative charge in the cloud-base; this tends to induce an
    area of positive charge on the ground.
- name: peakAmplitude
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: Peak current of strike.
