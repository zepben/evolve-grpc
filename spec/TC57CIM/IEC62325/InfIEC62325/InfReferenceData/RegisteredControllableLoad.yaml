name: RegisteredControllableLoad
description: Temporary holding for load reduction attributes removed from RegisteredLoad. Use for future use case when developing
  the RegisteredDistributedResource specialized classes.
attributes:
- name: maxReductionTime
  type: Float
  description: Maxiimum Load Reduction Time (min), per Participating Load Resource
- name: maxWeeklyDeployment
  type: Integer
  description: Maximum weekly deployments
- name: minLoadReduction
  type: ActivePower
  description: |-
    Minimum MW for a load reduction (e.g., MW rating of a discrete pump.

    This attribute may be used also in the LoadBid class. The reason that the attribute is also modeled in this class is that it is resource attribute and needs to be persistently stored.
- name: minLoadReductionCost
  type: CostPerEnergyUnit
  description: minimum load reduction cost. Single number for the load
- name: minLoadReductionInterval
  type: Float
  description: |-
    Shortest period load reduction shall be maintained before load can be restored to normal levels.

    This attribute may be used also in the LoadBid class. The reason that the attribute is also modeled in this class is that it is resource attribute and needs to be persistently stored.
- name: minReductionTime
  type: Float
  description: Minimum Load Reduction Time (min), per Participating Load Resource
- name: minTimeBetLoadRed
  type: Float
  description: |-
    Shortest time that load shall be left at normal levels before a new load reduction.

    This attribute may be used also in the LoadBid class. The reason that the attribute is also modeled in this class is that it is resource attribute and needs to be persistently stored.
- name: reqNoticeTime
  type: Float
  description: |-
    Time period that is required from an order to reduce a load to the time that it takes to get to the minimum load reduction.

    This attribute may be used also in the LoadBid class. The reason that the attribute is also modeled in this class is that it is resource attribute and needs to be persistently stored.
- name: maxBaseLoad
  type: ActivePower
  description: Maximum Base Load (MW), per Participating Load Resource
- name: maxDeploymentTime
  type: Float
  description: Maximum Deployment time (seconds)
- name: maxLoadRedTimesPerDay
  type: Integer
  description: Maximum Number of Daily Load Curtailments
- name: maxLoadReduction
  type: ActivePower
