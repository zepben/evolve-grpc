name: SensitivityPriceCurve
description: "Optionally, this curve expresses elasticity of the associated requirement.  For example, used to reduce requirements\
  \ when clearing price exceeds reasonable values when the supply quantity becomes scarce. For example, a single point value\
  \ of $1000/MW for a spinning reserve will cause a reduction in the required spinning reserve. \nX axis is constrained quantity\
  \ (e.g., MW)\nY1 axis is money per constrained quantity"
