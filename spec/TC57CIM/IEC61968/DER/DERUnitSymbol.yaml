  description: |-
    Relative temperature in degrees Celsius.
    In the SI unit system the symbol is ºC. Electric charge is measured in coulomb that has the unit symbol C. To distinguish degree Celsius form coulomb the symbol used in the UML is degC. Reason for not using ºC is the special character º is difficult to manage in software.

  description: Frequency in Hertz (1/s).
- name: W
  description: Real power in Watt (J/s). Electrical power may have real and reactive components. The real portion of electrical
    power (I²R or VIcos(phi)), is expressed in Watts. (See also apparent power and reactive power.)
- name: VA
  description: Apparent power in Volt Ampere (See also real power and reactive power.)
- name: VAr
  description: |-
    Reactive power in Volt Ampere reactive. The “reactive” or “imaginary” component of electrical power (VIsin(phi)). (See also real power and apparent power).
    Note: Different meter designs use different methods to arrive at their results. Some meters may compute reactive power as an arithmetic value, while others compute the value vectorially. The data consumer should determine the method in use and the suitability of the measurement for the intended purpose.
