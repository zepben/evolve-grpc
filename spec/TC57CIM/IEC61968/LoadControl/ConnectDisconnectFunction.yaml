- name: eventCount
  type: Integer
  description: Running cumulative count of connect or disconnect events, for the lifetime of this function or until the value
    is cleared.
- name: isConnected
  type: Boolean
  description: True if this function is in the connected state.
- name: isDelayedDiscon
  type: Boolean
  description: If set true, the switch may disconnect the service at the end of a specified time delay after the disconnect
    signal has been given. If set false, the switch may disconnect the service immediately after the disconnect signal has
    been given. This is typically the case for over current circuit-breakers which are classified as either instantaneous
    or slow acting.
- name: isLocalAutoDisconOp

  description: If set true and if disconnection can be operated locally, the operation happens automatically. Otherwise it
    happens manually.
- name: isLocalAutoReconOp
  type: Boolean
  description: If set true and if reconnection can be operated locally, then the operation happens automatically. Otherwise,
    it happens manually.
- name: isRemoteAutoDisconOp
  type: Boolean
  description: If set true and if disconnection can be operated remotely, then the operation happens automatically. If set
    false and if disconnection can be operated remotely, then the operation happens manually.
- name: isRemoteAutoReconOp
  type: Boolean
  description: If set true and if reconnection can be operated remotely, then the operation happens automatically. If set
