name: PositionPoint
description: Set of spatial coordinates that determine a point, defined in the coordinate system specified in 'Location.CoordinateSystem'.
  Use a single position point instance to describe a point-oriented location. Use a sequence of position points to describe
  a line-oriented object (physical location of non-point oriented objects like cables or lines), or area of an object (like
  a substation or a geographical zone - in this case, have first and last position point with the same values).
attributes:
- name: groupNumber
  type: Integer
  description: Zero-relative sequence number of this group within a series of points; used when there is a need to express
    disjoint groups of points that are considered to be part of a single location.
- name: sequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: Zero-relative sequence number of this point within a series of points.
- name: xPosition
  type: String
  description: X axis position.
- name: yPosition
  type: String
  description: Y axis position.
- name: zPosition
  type: String
  description: (if applicable) Z axis position.
