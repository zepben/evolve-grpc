    A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for the coordinate reference system (crs) used to define 'Location.PositionPoints'.
    An example would be the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) code for a coordinate reference system, defined in URN under the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) namespace as: urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::XXXX, where XXXX is an EPSG code (a full list of codes can be found at the EPSG Registry web site http://www.epsg-registry.org/). To define the coordinate system as being WGS84 (latitude, longitude) using an EPSG OGC, this attribute would be urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4236.
    A profile should limit this code to a set of allowed URNs agreed to by all sending and receiving parties.
