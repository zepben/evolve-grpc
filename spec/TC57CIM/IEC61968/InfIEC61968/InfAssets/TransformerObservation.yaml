name: TransformerObservation
description: Common information captured during transformer inspections and/or diagnostics. Note that some properties may
  be measured through other means and therefore have measurement values in addition to the observed values recorded here.
attributes:
- name: bushingTemp
  type: Temperature
  description: Bushing temperature.
- name: dga
  type: String
  description: 'Dissolved Gas Analysis. Typical values are: Acceptable, Overheating, Corona, Sparking, Arcing.'
- name: freqResp
  type: String
  description: 'Frequency Response Analysis. Typical values are: acceptable, slight movement, significant movement, failed,
    near failure. A graphic of the response diagram, which is a type of document, may be associated with this analysis through
    the recursive document relationship of the ProcedureDataSet.'
- name: furfuralDP
  type: String
  description: Overall measure of furfural in oil and mechanical strength of paper. DP, the degree of polymerization, is the
