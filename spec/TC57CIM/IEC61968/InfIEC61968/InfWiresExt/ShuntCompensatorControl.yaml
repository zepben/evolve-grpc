name: ShuntCompensatorControl
description: Distribution capacitor bank control settings.
attributes:
- name: branchDirect
  type: Integer
  description: 'For VAR, amp, or power factor locally controlled shunt impedances, the flow direction: in, out.'
- name: cellSize
  type: ReactivePower
  description: The size of the individual units that make up the bank.
- name: controlKind
  type: ShuntImpedanceControlKind
  description: Kind of control (if any).
- name: highVoltageOverride
  type: PU
  description: For locally controlled shunt impedances which have a voltage override feature, the high voltage override value.
    If the voltage is above this value, the shunt impedance will be turned off regardless of the other local controller settings.
- name: localControlKind
  type: ShuntImpedanceLocalControlKind
  description: Kind of local controller.
- name: localOffLevel
  type: String
  description: Upper control setting.
- name: localOnLevel
  type: String
  description: Lower control setting.
- name: localOverride
  type: Boolean
  description: True if the locally controlled capacitor has voltage override capability.
- name: lowVoltageOverride
  type: PU
  description: For locally controlled shunt impedances which have a voltage override feature, the low voltage override value.
    If the voltage is below this value, the shunt impedance will be turned on regardless of the other local controller settings.
- name: maxSwitchOperationCount
  type: Integer
  description: IdmsShuntImpedanceData.maxNumSwitchOps.
- name: normalOpen
  type: Boolean
  description: True if open is normal status for a fixed capacitor bank, otherwise normal status is closed.
- name: regBranch
  type: String
  description: For VAR, amp, or power factor locally controlled shunt impedances, the index of the regulation branch.
- name: regBranchEnd
  type: Integer
  description: 'For VAR, amp, or power factor locally controlled shunt impedances, the end of the branch that is regulated.
    The field has the following values: from side, to side, and tertiary (only if the branch is a transformer).'
- name: regBranchKind
  type: RegulationBranchKind
  description: (For VAR, amp, or power factor locally controlled shunt impedances) Kind of regulation branch.
- name: sensingPhaseCode
  type: PhaseCode
  description: Phases that are measured for controlling the device.
- name: switchOperationCycle
  type: Hours
  description: Time interval between consecutive switching operations.
- name: vRegLineLine
  type: Boolean
  description: True if regulated voltages are measured line to line, otherwise they are measured line to ground.
