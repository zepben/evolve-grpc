  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) are the codes that identify the type of products/service an industry is involved in, and used for statutory reporting purposes. For example, in the USA these codes are located by the federal government, and then published in a book entitled "The Standard Industrial Classification Manual". The codes are arranged in a hierarchical structure.
  Note that Residential Service Agreements are not classified according to the SIC codes.
