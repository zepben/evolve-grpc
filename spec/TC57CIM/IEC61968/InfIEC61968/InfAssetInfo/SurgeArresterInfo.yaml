name: SurgeArresterInfo
description: Properties of surge arrester.
attributes:
- name: continuousOperatingVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Maximum continuous power frequency voltage allowed on the surge arrester.
- name: isPolymer
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, the arrester has a polymer housing, porcelain otherwise.
- name: lightningImpulseDischargeVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Residual voltage during an 8x20 microsecond current impulse at the nominal discharge current level.
- name: lineDischargeClass
  type: Integer
  description: Determines the arrester energy discharge capability.  Choices are limited to 0 (none) through 5 (highest) by
    IEC 60099. Classes 1..3 require a 10-kA nominal discharge current. Classes 4..5 require a 20-kA nominal discharge current.
    Lower nominal discharge currents must use class 0.
- name: nominalDischargeCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: The lightning discharge current used to classify the arrester. Choices are limited to 1.5, 2.5, 5, 10, and
    20 kA by IEC 60099.
- name: pressureReliefClass
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: Fault current level at which all parts of the failed arrester lie within a circle prescribed by IEC 60099.
- name: ratedVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: The temporary overvoltage (TOV) level at power frequency that the surge arrester withstands for 10 seconds.
- name: steepFrontDischargeVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Residual voltage during a current impulse with front time of 1 microsecond, and magnitude equal to the nominal
    discharge current level.
- name: switchingImpulseDischargeVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Residual voltage during a current impulse with front time of at least 30 microseconds, and magnitude specified
    in IEC 60099 for the line discharge class. Does not apply to line discharge class 0.
