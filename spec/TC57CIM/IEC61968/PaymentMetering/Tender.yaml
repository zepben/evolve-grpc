name: Tender
description: |-
  Tender is what is "offered" by the customer towards making a payment and is often more than the required payment (hence the need for 'change'). The payment is thus that part of the Tender that goes towards settlement of a particular transaction.
  Tender is modelled as an aggregation of Cheque and Card. Both these tender types can exist in a single tender bid thus 'accountHolderName' has to exist separately in each of Cheque and Card as each could have a different account holder name.
