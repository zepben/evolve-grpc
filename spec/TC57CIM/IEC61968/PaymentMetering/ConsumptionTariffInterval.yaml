name: ConsumptionTariffInterval
description: One of a sequence of intervals defined in terms of consumption quantity of a service such as electricity, water,
  gas, etc. It is typically used in association with TariffProfile to define the steps or blocks in a step tariff structure,
  where startValue simultaneously defines the entry value of this step and the closing value of the previous step. Where consumption
  is >= startValue it falls within this interval and where consumption is < startValue it falls within the previous interval.
attributes:
- name: sequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: A sequential reference that defines the identity of this interval and its relative position with respect to
    other intervals in a sequence of intervals.
- name: startValue
  type: Float
  description: The lowest level of consumption that defines the starting point of this interval. The interval extends to the
    start of the next interval or until it is reset to the start of the first interval by TariffProfile.tariffCycle.
