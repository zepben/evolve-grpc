name: TimeTariffInterval
description: One of a sequence of time intervals defined in terms of real time. It is typically used in association with TariffProfile
  to define the intervals in a time of use tariff structure, where startDateTime simultaneously determines the starting point
  of this interval and the ending point of the previous interval.
attributes:
- name: sequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: A sequential reference that defines the identity of this interval and its relative position with respect to
    other intervals in a sequence of intervals.
- name: startTime
  type: Time
  description: A real time marker that defines the starting time (typically it is the time of day) for this interval. The
    interval extends to the start of the next interval or until it is reset to the start of the first interval by TariffProfile.tariffCycle.
