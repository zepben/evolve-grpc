name: EndDeviceControl
description: Instructs an end device (or an end device group) to perform a specified action.
attributes:
- name: drProgramLevel
  type: Integer
  description: 'Level of a demand response program request, where 0=emergency. Note: Attribute is not defined on DemandResponseProgram
    as it is not its inherent property (it serves to control it).'
- name: drProgramMandatory
  type: Boolean
  description: 'Whether a demand response program request is mandatory. Note: Attribute is not defined on DemandResponseProgram
    as it is not its inherent property (it serves to control it).'
- name: issuerID
  type: String
  description: Unique identifier of the business entity originating an end device control.
- name: issuerTrackingID
  type: String
  description: Identifier assigned by the initiator (e.g. retail electric provider) of an end device control action to uniquely
    identify the demand response event, text message, or other subject of the control action. Can be used when cancelling
    an event or text message request or to identify the originating event or text message in a consequential end device event.
- name: priceSignal
  type: FloatQuantity
  description: (if applicable) Price signal used as parameter for this end device control.
- name: primaryDeviceTiming
  type: EndDeviceTiming
  description: Timing for the control actions performed on the device identified in the end device control.
- name: reason
  type: String
  description: Reason for the control action that allows to determine how to continue processing. For example, disconnect
    meter command may require different processing by the receiving system if it has been issued for a network-related reason
    (protection) or for a payment-related reason.
- name: scheduledInterval
  type: DateTimeInterval
  description: (if control has scheduled duration) Date and time interval the control has been scheduled to execute within.
- name: secondaryDeviceTiming
  type: EndDeviceTiming
  description: Timing for the control actions performed by devices that are responding to event related information sent to
    the primary device indicated in the end device control.  For example, load control actions performed by a PAN device in
    response to demand response event information sent to a PAN gateway server.
