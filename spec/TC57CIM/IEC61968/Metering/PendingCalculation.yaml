name: PendingCalculation
description: When present, a scalar conversion that needs to be applied to every IntervalReading.value contained in IntervalBlock.
  This conversion results in a new associated ReadingType, reflecting the true dimensions of IntervalReading values after
  the conversion.
attributes:
- name: multiplyBeforeAdd
  type: Boolean
  description: Whether scalars should be applied before adding the 'offset'.
- name: offset
  type: Integer
  description: (if applicable) Offset to be added as well as multiplication using scalars.
- name: scalarDenominator
  type: Integer
  description: (if scalar is rational number) When 'IntervalReading.value' is multiplied by 'scalarNumerator' and divided
    by this value, it causes a unit of measure conversion to occur, resulting in the 'ReadingType.unit'.
- name: scalarFloat
  type: Float
  description: (if scalar is floating number) When multiplied with 'IntervalReading.value', it causes a unit of measure conversion
    to occur, according to the 'ReadingType.unit'.
- name: scalarNumerator
  type: Integer
  description: (if scalar is integer or rational number)  When the scalar is a simple integer, and this attribute is presented
    alone and multiplied with 'IntervalReading.value', it causes a unit of measure conversion to occur, resulting in the 'ReadingType.unit'.
    It is never used in conjunction with 'scalarFloat', only with 'scalarDenominator'.
