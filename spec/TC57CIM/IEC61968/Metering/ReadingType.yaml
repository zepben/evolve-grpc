name: ReadingType
description: 'Detailed description for a type of a reading value. Values in attributes allow for the creation of recommended
  codes to be used for identifying reading value types as follows: <macroPeriod>.<aggregate>.<measuringPeriod>.<accumulation>.<flowDirection>.<commodity>.<measurementKind>.<interharmonic.numerator>.<interharmonic.denominator>.<argument.numerator>.<argument.denominator>.<tou>.<cpp>.<consumptionTier>.<phases>.<multiplier>.<unit>.<currency>.'
attributes:
- name: accumulation
  type: AccumulationKind
  description: Accumulation behaviour of a reading over time, usually 'measuringPeriod', to be used with individual endpoints
    (as opposed to 'macroPeriod' and 'aggregate' that are used to describe aggregations of data from individual endpoints).
- name: aggregate
  type: AggregateKind
  description: Salient attribute of the reading data aggregated from individual endpoints. This is mainly used to define a
    mathematical operation carried out over 'macroPeriod', but may also be used to describe an attribute of the data when
    the 'macroPeriod' is not defined.
- name: argument
  type: RationalNumber
  description: |-
    Argument used to introduce numbers into the unit of measure description where they are needed (e.g., 4 where the measure needs an argument such as CEMI(n=4)). Most arguments used in practice however will be integers (i.e., 'denominator'=1).
    Value 0 in 'numerator' and 'denominator' means not applicable.
- name: commodity
  type: CommodityKind
  description: Commodity being measured.
- name: consumptionTier
  type: Integer
  description: |-
    In case of common flat-rate pricing for power, in which all purchases are at a given rate, 'consumptionTier'=0. Otherwise, the value indicates the consumption tier, which can be used in conjunction with TOU or CPP pricing.
    Consumption tier pricing refers to the method of billing in which a certain "block" of energy is purchased/sold at one price, after which the next block of energy is purchased at another price, and so on, all throughout a defined period. At the start of the defined period, consumption is initially zero, and any usage is measured against the first consumption tier ('consumptionTier'=1). If this block of energy is consumed before the end of the period, energy consumption moves to be reconed against the second consumption tier ('consumptionTier'=2), and so on. At the end of the defined period, the consumption accumulator is reset, and usage within the 'consumptionTier'=1 restarts.
- name: cpp
  type: Integer
  description: Critical peak period (CPP) bucket the reading value is attributed to. Value 0 means not applicable. Even though
    CPP is usually considered a specialised form of time of use 'tou', this attribute is defined explicitly for flexibility.
- name: currency
  type: Currency
  description: Metering-specific currency.
- name: flowDirection
  type: FlowDirectionKind
  description: Flow direction for a reading where the direction of flow of the commodity is important (for electricity measurements
    this includes current, energy, power, and demand).
- name: interharmonic
  type: ReadingInterharmonic
  description: Indication of a "harmonic" or "interharmonic" basis for the measurement. Value 0 in 'numerator' and 'denominator'
    means not applicable.
- name: macroPeriod
  type: MacroPeriodKind
  description: Time period of interest that reflects how the reading is viewed or captured over a long period of time.
- name: measurementKind
  type: MeasurementKind
  description: 'Identifies "what" is being measured, as refinement of ''commodity''. When combined with ''unit'', it provides
    detail to the unit of measure. For example, ''energy'' with a unit of measure of ''kWh'' indicates to the user that active
    energy is being measured, while with ''kVAh'' or ''kVArh'', it indicates apparent energy and reactive energy, respectively.
    ''power'' can be combined in a similar way with various power units of measure: Distortion power (''distortionVoltAmperes'')
    with ''kVA'' is different from ''power'' with ''kVA''.'
- name: measuringPeriod
  type: MeasuringPeriodKind
  description: |-
    Time attribute inherent or fundamental to the reading value (as opposed to 'macroPeriod' that supplies an "adjective" to describe aspects of a time period with regard to the measurement). It refers to the way the value was originally measured and not to the frequency at which it is reported or presented. For example, an hourly interval of consumption data would have value 'hourly' as an attribute. However in the case of an hourly sampled voltage value, the meterReadings schema would carry the 'hourly' interval size information.
    It is common for meters to report demand in a form that is measured over the course of a portion of an hour, while enterprise applications however commonly assume the demand (in kW or kVAr) normalised to 1 hour. The system that receives readings directly from the meter therefore shall perform this transformation before publishing readings for use by the other enterprise systems. The scalar used is chosen based on the block size (not any sub-interval size).
- name: multiplier
  type: UnitMultiplier
  description: Metering-specific multiplier.
- name: phases
  type: PhaseCode
  description: Metering-specific phase code.
- name: tou
  type: Integer
  description: Time of use (TOU) bucket the reading value is attributed to. Value 0 means not applicable.
- name: unit
  type: UnitSymbol
  description: Metering-specific unit.
