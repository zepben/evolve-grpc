description: Abstraction for management of group communications within a two-way AMR system or the data for a group of related
  end devices. Commands can be issued to all of the end devices that belong to the group using a defined group address and
  the underlying AMR communication infrastructure. A DERGroup and a PANDeviceGroup is an EndDeviceGroup.
