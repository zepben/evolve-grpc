  IntervalReading
  Data captured at regular intervals of time. Interval data could be captured as incremental data, absolute data, or relative data. The source for the data is usually a tariff quantity or an engineering quantity. Data is typically captured in time-tagged, uniform, fixed-length intervals of 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, or 60 min.
  Note: Interval Data is sometimes also called "Interval Data Readings" (IDR).
