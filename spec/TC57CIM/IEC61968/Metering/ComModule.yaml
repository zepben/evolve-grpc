name: ComModule
description: An asset having communications capabilities that can be paired with a meter or other end device to provide the
  device with communication ability, through associated communication function. An end device that has communications capabilities
  through embedded hardware can use that function directly (without the communication module), or combine embedded communication
  function with additional communication functions provided through an external communication module (e.g. zigbee).
