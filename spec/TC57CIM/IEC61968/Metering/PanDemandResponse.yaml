name: PanDemandResponse
description: PAN control used to issue action/command to PAN devices during a demand response/load control event.
attributes:
- name: appliance
  type: ControlledAppliance
  description: Appliance being controlled.
- name: avgLoadAdjustment
  type: PerCent
  description: |-
    Used to define a maximum energy usage limit as a percentage of the client implementations specific average energy usage. The load adjustment percentage is added to 100% creating a percentage limit applied to the client implementations specific average energy usage. A -10% load adjustment percentage will establish an energy usage limit equal to 90% of the client implementations specific average energy usage. Each load adjustment percentage is referenced to the client implementations specific average energy usage. There are no cumulative effects.
    The range of this field is -100% to +100% with a resolution of 1. A -100% value equals a total load shed. A +100% value will limit the energy usage to the client implementations specific average energy usage.
- name: cancelControlMode
  type: String
  description: Encoding of cancel control.
- name: cancelDateTime
  type: DateTime
  description: Timestamp when a canceling of the event is scheduled to start.
- name: cancelNow
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, a canceling of the event should start immediately.
- name: coolingOffset
  type: Temperature
  description: Requested offset to apply to the normal cooling setpoint at the time of the start of the event. It represents
    a temperature change that will be applied to the associated cooling set point. The temperature offsets will be calculated
    per the local temperature in the thermostat. The calculated temperature will be interpreted as the number of degrees to
    be added to the cooling set point. Sequential demand response events are not cumulative. The offset shall be applied to
    the normal setpoint.
- name: coolingSetpoint
  type: Temperature
  description: Requested cooling set point. Temperature set point is typically defined and calculated based on local temperature.
- name: criticalityLevel
  type: String
  description: Level of criticality for the action of this control. The action taken by load control devices for an event
    can be solely based on this value, or in combination with other load control event fields supported by the device.
- name: dutyCycle
  type: PerCent
  description: Maximum "on" state duty cycle as a percentage of time. For example, if the value is 80, the device would be
    in an "on" state for 80% of the time for the duration of the action.
- name: enrollmentGroup
  type: String
  description: Provides a mechanism to direct load control actions to groups of PAN devices. It can be used in conjunction
    with the PAN device types.
- name: heatingOffset
  type: Temperature
  description: Requested offset to apply to the normal heating setpoint at the time of the start of the event. It represents
    a temperature change that will be applied to the associated heating set point. The temperature offsets will be calculated
    per the local temperature in the thermostat. The calculated temperature will be interpreted as the number of degrees to
    be subtracted from the heating set point. Sequential demand response events are not cumulative. The offset shall be applied
    to the normal setpoint.
- name: heatingSetpoint
  type: Temperature
  description: Requested heating set point. Temperature set point is typically defined and calculated based on local temperature.
