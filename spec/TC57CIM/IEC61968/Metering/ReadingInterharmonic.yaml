name: ReadingInterharmonic
description: Interharmonics are represented as a rational number 'numerator' / 'denominator', and harmonics are represented
  using the same mechanism and identified by 'denominator'=1.
attributes:
- name: denominator
  type: Integer
  description: Interharmonic denominator. Value 0 means not applicable. Value 2 is used in combination with 'numerator'=1
    to represent interharmonic 1/2. Finally, value 1 indicates the harmonic of the order specified with 'numerator'.
- name: numerator
  type: Integer
  description: Interharmonic numerator. Value 0 means not applicable. Value 1 is used in combination with 'denominator'=2
    to represent interharmonic 1/2, and with 'denominator'=1 it represents fundamental frequency. Finally, values greater
    than 1 indicate the harmonic of that order (e.g., 'numerator'=5 is the fifth harmonic).
