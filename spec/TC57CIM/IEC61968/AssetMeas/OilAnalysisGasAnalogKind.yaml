  description: isoC4 (C4H10) concentration (in ppm, specifically in microlitre/litre). Isobutane is also known as methylpropane.
- name: equivalentTCGPercent
  description: |-
    Equivalent Total Combustible Gas (ETCG) percent.
    An estimate, calculated from the dissolved-gas concentrations and the oil sample temperature, of what the TCG would be in a gas space in equilibrium with the oil. ETCG reflects what the TCG would be in air spaces near the oil.
- name: totalHeatGas
  description: Sum of concentrations of methane, ethane, and ethylene (in ppm, specifically in microlitre/litre). Used in
    some diagnostic gas ratios, especially THG/acetylene, which compares “heat gas” to “arcing gas.”
- name: totalDissolvedCombustibleGas
  description: 'Total dissolved combustible gas concentration (in ppm, specifically in microlitre/litre). Calculated by adding
    the ppm of combustible gasses: hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), acetylene (C2H2), and carbon
    monoxide (CO).'
- name: totalPartialPressure
  description: |-
    Total partial pressure (in Pa).
    Calculated value reflecting total of partial pressures of all combustible gasses.
- name: estimatedSafeHandlingLimit
  description: "Estimated Safe Handling Limit (ESHL) (in percent). Estimated safe handling limit is an estimate of the lower\
    \ flammability limit (LFL) of the combustible gas mixture which the dissolved gas in the oil would give off by the oil\
    \ if exposed to air. \nExpressed in percent like the equivalent total combustible gas percent, it is calculated from the\
    \ dissolved-gas concentrations, the oil sample temperature, and the lower flammability limits of the individual combustible\
    \ gases."
- name: hydran
