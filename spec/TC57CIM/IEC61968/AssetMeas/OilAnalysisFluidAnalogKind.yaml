  description: Dielectric breakdown, for electrode gap size and temperature specified by selected standard  (in kV).
- name: powerFactorPercent
  description: 'Fluid power factor at specified temperature (in percent). Commonly used in US. (Note: Fluid power factor is
    very similar to fluid dissapation factor, but fluid power factor is cosine of the phase angle between an AC voltage applied
    to oil and the resulting current (where dissipation factor is the tangent). For values up to 0.005, fluid power factor
    and dissapation factor are very close. There is a conversion equation between the two).'
- name: dissipationFactor
  description: Fluid dissipation factor in absolute value, not a percentage. (Multiplying this value by 100 would result in
    dissipation factor percent).

  description: Pour point (in °C) determined by automatic method. The pour point of a liquid is the temperature at which it
    becomes semi solid and loses its flow characteristics.
- name: kinematicViscosity
  description: Kinematic viscosity (in millimetre2/second). Kinematic viscosity is the ratio of - absolute (or dynamic) viscosity
    to density.
- name: staticElectrification
