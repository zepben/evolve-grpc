name: UnplannedOutage
description: |-
  Document describing the consequence of an unplanned outage in a part of the electrical network. For the purposes of this model, an unplanned outage refers to a state where energy is not delivered; such as, customers out of service, a street light is not served, etc.
  A unplanned outage may be created upon:
  - impacts the SAIDI calculation
  - a breaker trip,
  - a fault indicator status change,
  - a meter event indicating customer outage,
  - a reception of one or more customer trouble calls, or
  - an operator command, reflecting information obtained from the field crew.
  Outage restoration may be performed using a switching plan which complements the outage information with detailed switching activities, including the relationship to the crew and work.
