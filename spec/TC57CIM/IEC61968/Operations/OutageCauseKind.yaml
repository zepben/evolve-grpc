  description: This outage was caused by an animal is was unplanned.  As such it is treated as a forced outage and is probably
    classified as "trouble" with a Trouble Ticket as well as a work/service order.  The primary difference between this and
    an unplanned outage is the reason for the outage.  If an animal caused this and perished as a result, the utility may
    have other actions that are required to be taken by the EPA or other groups with whom the utility has an agreement.
