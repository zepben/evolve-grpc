  sourceDescription: Action involving grounding operation on this conducting equipment.
  targetName: GroundedEquipment
  targetDescription: Equipment being grounded with this operation. In case of placing a ground anywhere along a line segment,
    you must use the clamp (to get the distance from one terminal), so use the explicit relation with line segment. In all
    other cases (including placing the ground at a line segment terminal), reference to one or more conducting equipment is
    sufficient.

  sourceName: LineGroundingAction
  sourceDescription: Ground action involving clamp usage (for the case when the ground is applied along the line segment instead
    of at its terminals).
  targetName: AlongACLineSegment
  targetDescription: The line segment that this ground action will affect. This is the only way to access relationship to
    clamp in case the ground needs to be placed along the line segment.
