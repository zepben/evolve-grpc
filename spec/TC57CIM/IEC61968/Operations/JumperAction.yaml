  sourceName: LineJumpingAction
  sourceDescription: Jumper action involving clamp usage (for the case when the jumper is applied along the line segment instead
    of at its terminals).
  targetCardinality: 0..*
  targetName: ACLineSegments
  targetDescription: The line segment that this jumper action will affect. This is the only way to access relationship to
    clamp in case the jumper needs to connect along the line segment.

  sourceDescription: Jumper action involving jumping operation on this conducting equipment.
  targetCardinality: 0..*
  targetName: JumpedEquipments
  targetDescription: Conducting equipment is affected when the jumper action connects one or both ends of a jumper to the
    conducting equipment. If the jumper action involves placing one or both ends of a jumper anywhere along a line segment,
    you must use the clamp (to get the distance from one terminal), using the explicit relation with clamp. In the case of
    placing one or both ends of the jumper at a line segment terminal, reference to one or more line segments is sufficient.
