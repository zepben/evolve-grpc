name: SwitchingStep
description: Atomic switching step; can be part of a switching step group, or part of a switching plan.
attributes:
- name: isFreeSequence
  type: Boolean
  description: For a step, if isFreeSequence is set to false or is not specified, all of the steps in the group must be executed
    in the order defined by the sequenceNumber attribute. The sequenceNumber for a step has a different meaning when there
    are two or more sequential steps that have the isFreeSequence attribute set to true. Execution must still be performed
    in sequenceNumber order until a set of two or more steps that have isFreeSequence set to true is encountered. In this
    case, these steps can be executed in any sequence, until a step is encountered that has isFreeSequence set to false. All
    of the steps preceding this step must be executed before the step can be executed.
- name: sequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: Order of this activity in the sequence of activities within the switching plan.
- name: subStepSequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: Supports compound switching steps that are made up of several sub steps.
