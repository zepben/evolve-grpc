name: WireSpacingInfo
description: Wire spacing data that associates multiple wire positions with the line segment, and allows to calculate line
  segment impedances. Number of phases can be derived from the number of associated wire positions whose phase is not neutral.
attributes:
- name: isCable
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, this spacing data describes a cable.
- name: phaseWireCount
  type: Integer
  description: Number of wire sub-conductors in the symmetrical bundle (typically between 1 and 4).
- name: phaseWireSpacing
  type: Length
  description: Distance between wire sub-conductors in a symmetrical bundle.
- name: usage
  type: WireUsageKind
  description: Usage of the associated wires.
