name: OperationalLimitSet
description: A set of limits associated with equipment.  Sets of limits might apply to a specific temperature, or season for
  example. A set of limits may contain different severities of limit levels that would apply to the same equipment. The set
  may contain limits of different types such as apparent power and current limits or high and low voltage limits  that are
  logically applied together as a set.
