name: OperationalLimitType
description: The operational meaning of a category of limits.
attributes:
- name: acceptableDuration
  type: Seconds
  description: The nominal acceptable duration of the limit. Limits are commonly expressed in terms of the time limit for
    which the limit is normally acceptable. The actual acceptable duration of a specific limit may depend on other local factors
    such as temperature or wind speed. The attribute has meaning only if the flag isInfiniteDuration is set to false, hence
    it shall not be exchanged when isInfiniteDuration is set to true.
- name: direction
  type: OperationalLimitDirectionKind
  description: The direction of the limit.
- name: isInfiniteDuration
  type: Boolean
  description: Defines if the operational limit type has infinite duration. If true, the limit has infinite duration. If false,
    the limit has definite duration which is defined by the attribute acceptableDuration.
