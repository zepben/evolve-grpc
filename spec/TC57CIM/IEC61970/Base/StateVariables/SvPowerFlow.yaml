name: SvPowerFlow
description: State variable for power flow. Load convention is used for flow direction. This means flow out from the TopologicalNode
  into the equipment is positive.
attributes:
- name: phase
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: The individual phase of the flow.   If unspecified, then assumed to be balanced among phases.
- name: p
  type: ActivePower
  description: The active power flow. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode
    (bus) into the conducting equipment.
- name: q
  type: ReactivePower
  description: The reactive power flow. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode
    (bus) into the conducting equipment.
