name: SvInjection
description: The SvInjection reports the calculated bus injection minus the sum of the terminal flows. The terminal flow is
  positive out from the bus (load sign convention) and bus injection has positive flow into the bus. SvInjection may have
  the remainder after state estimation or slack after power flow calculation.
attributes:
- name: phase
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: The terminal phase at which the connection is applied.   If missing, the injection is assumed to be balanced
    among non-neutral phases.
- name: pInjection
  type: ActivePower
  description: The active power mismatch between calculated injection and initial injection.  Positive sign means injection
    into the TopologicalNode (bus).
- name: qInjection
  type: ReactivePower
  description: The reactive power mismatch between calculated injection and initial injection.  Positive sign means injection
    into the TopologicalNode (bus).
