name: IncrementalHeatRateCurve
description: Relationship between unit incremental heat rate in (delta energy/time) per (delta active power) and unit output
  in active power. The IHR curve represents the slope of the HeatInputCurve. Note that the "incremental heat rate" and the
  "heat rate" have the same engineering units.
attributes:
