name: Reservoir
description: 'A water storage facility within a hydro system, including: ponds, lakes, lagoons, and rivers. The storage is
  usually behind some type of dam.'
attributes:
- name: activeStorageCapacity
  type: Volume
  description: Storage volume between the full supply level and the normal minimum operating level.
- name: energyStorageRating
  type: Float
  description: The reservoir's energy storage rating in energy for given head conditions.
