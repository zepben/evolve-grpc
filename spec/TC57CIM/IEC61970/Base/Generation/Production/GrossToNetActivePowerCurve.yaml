name: GrossToNetActivePowerCurve
description: Relationship between the generating unit's gross active power output on the X-axis (measured at the terminals
  of the machine(s)) and the generating unit's net active power output on the Y-axis (based on utility-defined measurements
  at the power station). Station service loads, when modelled, should be treated as non-conforming bus loads. There may be
  more than one curve, depending on the auxiliary equipment that is in service.
