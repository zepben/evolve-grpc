name: EmissionCurve
description: Relationship between the unit's emission rate in units of mass per hour (Y-axis) and output active power (X-axis)
  for a given type of emission. This curve applies when only one type of fuel is being burned.
attributes:
- name: emissionContent
  type: Emission
  description: The emission content per quantity of fuel burned.
- name: emissionType
  type: EmissionType
  description: The type of emission, which also gives the production rate measurement unit. The y1AxisUnits of the curve contains
    the unit of measure (e.g. kg) and the emissionType is the type of emission (e.g. sulfur dioxide).
- name: isNetGrossP
  type: Boolean
  description: Flag is set to true when output is expressed in net active power.
