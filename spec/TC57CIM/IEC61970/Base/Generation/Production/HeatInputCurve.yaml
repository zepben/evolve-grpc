name: HeatInputCurve
description: Relationship between unit heat input in energy per time for main fuel (Y1-axis) and supplemental fuel (Y2-axis)
  versus unit output in active power (X-axis). The quantity of main fuel used to sustain generation at this output level is
  prorated for throttling between definition points. The quantity of supplemental fuel used at this output level is fixed
  and not prorated.
