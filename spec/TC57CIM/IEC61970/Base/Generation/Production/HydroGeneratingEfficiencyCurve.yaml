description: |-
  Relationship between unit efficiency as percentage and unit output active power for a given net head in meters. The relationship between efficiency, discharge, head, and power output is expressed as follows:   E =KP/HQ
  where:  E is the efficiency, as a percentage; P is the active power; H is the height; Q is the discharge, volume/time unit; K is a constant.
  For example, a curve instance for a given net head could show efficiency (Y-axis) versus active power output (X-axis) or versus discharge on the X-axis.
