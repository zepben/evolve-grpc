name: GenUnitOpCostCurve
description: Relationship between unit operating cost (Y-axis) and unit output active power (X-axis). The operating cost curve
  for thermal units is derived from heat input and fuel costs. The operating cost curve for hydro units is derived from water
  flow rates and equivalent water costs.
