name: FossilFuel
description: The fossil fuel consumed by the non-nuclear thermal generating unit.   For example, coal, oil, gas, etc.   These
  are the specific fuels that the generating unit can consume.
attributes:
- name: fossilFuelType
  type: FuelType
  description: The type of fossil fuel, such as coal, oil, or gas.
- name: fuelCost
  type: CostPerHeatUnit
  description: The cost in terms of heat value for the given type of fuel.
- name: fuelDispatchCost
  type: CostPerHeatUnit
  description: 'The cost of fuel used for economic dispatching which includes: fuel cost, transportation cost,  and incremental
    maintenance cost.'
- name: fuelEffFactor
  type: PU
  description: The efficiency factor for the fuel (per unit) in terms of the effective energy absorbed.
- name: fuelHandlingCost
  type: CostPerHeatUnit
  description: Handling and processing cost associated with this fuel.
- name: fuelHeatContent
  type: Float
  description: The amount of heat per weight (or volume) of the given type of fuel.
- name: fuelMixture
  type: PerCent
  description: Relative amount of the given type of fuel, when multiple fuels are being consumed.
- name: fuelSulfur
  type: PU
  description: The fuel's fraction of pollution credit per unit of heat content.
- name: highBreakpointP
  type: ActivePower
  description: The active power output level of the unit at which the given type of fuel is switched on. This fuel (e.g.,
    oil) is sometimes used to supplement the base fuel (e.g., coal) at high active power output levels.
- name: lowBreakpointP
  type: ActivePower
  description: The active power output level of the unit at which the given type of fuel is switched off. This fuel (e.g.,
    oil) is sometimes used to stabilize the base fuel (e.g., coal) at low active power output levels.
