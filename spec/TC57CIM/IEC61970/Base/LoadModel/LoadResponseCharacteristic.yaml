name: LoadResponseCharacteristic
description: "Models the characteristic response of the load demand due to changes in system conditions such as voltage and\
  \ frequency. It is not related to demand response.\nIf LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is True, the exponential\
  \ voltage or frequency dependent models are specified and used as to calculate active and reactive power components of the\
  \ load model.\nThe equations to calculate active and reactive power components of the load model are internal to the power\
  \ flow calculation, hence they use different quantities depending on the use case of the data exchange. \nThe equations\
  \ for exponential voltage dependent load model injected power are: \npInjection= Pnominal* (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)\
  \ ** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent\nqInjection= Qnominal* (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) **\
  \ cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent\nWhere: \n1) * means \"multiply\" and ** is \"raised to power of\";\n\
  2) Pnominal and Qnominal represent the active power and reactive power at nominal voltage as any load described by the voltage\
  \ exponential model shall be given at nominal voltage.  This means that EnergyConsumer.p and EnergyConsumer.q  are at nominal\
  \ voltage.\n3) After power flow is solved: \n-pInjection and qInjection correspond to SvPowerflow.p and SvPowerflow.q respectively.\
  \  \n- Voltage corresponds to SvVoltage.v at the TopologicalNode where the load is connected."
