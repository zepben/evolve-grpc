name: VsQpccControlKind
description: Kind of reactive power control at point of common coupling for a voltage source converter.
attributes:
- name: reactivePcc
  description: Control is reactive power at point of common coupling. Target is provided by VsConverter.targetQpcc.
- name: voltagePcc
  description: Control is voltage at point of common coupling. Target is provided by VsConverter.targetUpcc.
- name: powerFactorPcc
  description: Control is power factor at point of common coupling. Target is provided by VsConverter.targetPowerFactorPcc.
- name: pulseWidthModulation
  description: No explicit control. Pulse-modulation factor is directly set in magnitude (VsConverter.targetPWMfactor) and
    phase (VsConverter.targetPhasePcc).
