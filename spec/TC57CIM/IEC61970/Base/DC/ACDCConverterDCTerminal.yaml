name: ACDCConverterDCTerminal
description: A DC electrical connection point at the AC/DC converter. The AC/DC converter is electrically connected also to
  the AC side. The AC connection is inherited from the AC conducting equipment in the same way as any other AC equipment.
  The AC/DC converter DC terminal is separate from generic DC terminal to restrict the connection with the AC side to AC/DC
  converter and so that no other DC conducting equipment can be connected to the AC side.
attributes:
- name: polarity
  type: DCPolarityKind
  description: |-
    Represents the normal network polarity condition. Depending on the converter configuration the value shall be set as follows:
    - For a monopole with two converter terminals use DCPolarityKind “positive” and “negative”.
    - For a bi-pole or symmetric monopole with three converter terminals use DCPolarityKind “positive”, “middle” and “negative”.
