name: DCTopologicalIsland
description: "An electrically connected subset of the network. DC topological islands can change as the current network state\
  \ changes, e.g. due to: \n- disconnect switches or breakers changing state in a SCADA/EMS.\n- manual creation, change or\
  \ deletion of topological nodes in a planning tool.\nOnly energised TopologicalNode-s shall be part of the topological island."
