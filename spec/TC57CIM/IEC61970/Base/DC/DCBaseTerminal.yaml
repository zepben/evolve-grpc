name: DCBaseTerminal
description: An electrical connection point at a piece of DC conducting equipment. DC terminals are connected at one physical
  DC node that may have multiple DC terminals connected. A DC node is similar to an AC connectivity node. The model requires
  that DC connections are distinct from AC connections.
