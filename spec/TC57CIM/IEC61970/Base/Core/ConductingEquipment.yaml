  target: ProtectiveActionAdjustment
  sourceCardinality: "1"
  targetCardinality: 0..*
  sourceName: ConductingEquipment
  sourceDescription: ConductingEquipment whose operating condition is changed when this protective action adjustment gets
    activated.
  targetName: ProtectiveActionAdjustment
  targetDescription: The operating condition to the Conducting Equipment is changed when protective action adjustment is activated.
    For ShuntCompensator or other conducting equipment that operates on discrete values (integer), the values given in float
    will be rounded.

  sourceName: BaseVoltage
  sourceDescription: Base voltage of this conducting equipment.  Use only when there is no voltage level container used and
    only one base voltage applies.  For example, not used for transformers.
  targetName: ConductingEquipment
  targetDescription: All conducting equipment with this base voltage.  Use only when there is no voltage level container used
    and only one base voltage applies.  For example, not used for transformers.

  sourceName: Terminals
  sourceDescription: Conducting equipment have terminals that may be connected to other conducting equipment terminals via
    connectivity nodes or topological nodes.
  targetName: ConductingEquipment
  targetDescription: The conducting equipment of the terminal.  Conducting equipment have  terminals that may be connected
    to other conducting equipment terminals via connectivity nodes or topological nodes.

  targetCardinality: 0..*
  sourceName: JumpingAction
  sourceDescription: Jumper action involving jumping operation on this conducting equipment.
  targetName: JumpedEquipments
  targetDescription: Conducting equipment is affected when the jumper action connects one or both ends of a jumper to the
    conducting equipment. If the jumper action involves placing one or both ends of a jumper anywhere along a line segment,
    you must use the clamp (to get the distance from one terminal), using the explicit relation with clamp. In the case of
    placing one or both ends of the jumper at a line segment terminal, reference to one or more line segments is sufficient.

  target: ConductingEquipment
  sourceCardinality: 0..1
  targetCardinality: 0..1
  sourceName: GroundingAction
  sourceDescription: Action involving grounding operation on this conducting equipment.
  targetName: GroundedEquipment
  targetDescription: Equipment being grounded with this operation. In case of placing a ground anywhere along a line segment,
    you must use the clamp (to get the distance from one terminal), so use the explicit relation with line segment. In all
    other cases (including placing the ground at a line segment terminal), reference to one or more conducting equipment is
    sufficient.
