name: VoltageLevel
description: A collection of equipment at one common system voltage forming a switchgear. The equipment typically consists
  of breakers, busbars, instrumentation, control, regulation and protection devices as well as assemblies of all these.
attributes:
- name: highVoltageLimit
  type: Voltage
  description: |-
    The bus bar's high voltage limit.
    The limit applies to all equipment and nodes contained in a given VoltageLevel. It is not required that it is exchanged in pair with lowVoltageLimit. It is preferable to use operational VoltageLimit, which prevails, if present.
