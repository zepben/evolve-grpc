name: BaseFrequency
description: The BaseFrequency class describes a base frequency for a power system network. In case of multiple power networks
  with different frequencies, e.g. 50 Hz or 60 Hz each network will have its own base frequency class. Hence it is assumed
  that power system objects having different base frequencies appear in separate documents where each document has a single
  base frequency instance.
