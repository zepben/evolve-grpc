description: |-
  A collection of equipment for organizational purposes, used for grouping distribution resources.
  The organization a feeder does not necessarily reflect connectivity or current operation state.

  sourceName: NormalEnergizedFeeder
  sourceDescription: The normal energized feeders of the substation. Also used for naming purposes.
  targetName: NormalEnergizingSubstation
  targetDescription: The substation that nominally energizes the feeder.  Also used for naming purposes.

  sourceName: NamingFeeder
  sourceDescription: The primary feeder that normally energizes the secondary substation. Used for naming purposes.  Either
    this association or the substation to subgeographical region should be used for hierarchical containment specification.
  targetName: NamingSecondarySubstation
  targetDescription: The secondary substations that are normally energized from the feeder.  Used for naming purposes.   Should
    be consistent with the other associations for energizing terminal specification and the feeder energization specification.

  target: Terminal
  sourceCardinality: 0..1
  targetCardinality: 1..*
  sourceName: NormalHeadFeeder
  sourceDescription: The feeder that this terminal normally feeds.  Only specified for the terminals at head of feeders.
  targetName: NormalHeadTerminal
  targetDescription: The normal head terminal or terminals of the feeder.

  sourceName: NormalEnergizingFeeder
  sourceDescription: The feeders that potentially energize  the downstream substation.  Should be consistent with the associations
    that describe the naming hierarchy.
  targetName: NormalEnergizedSubstation
  targetDescription: The substations that are normally energized by the feeder.
