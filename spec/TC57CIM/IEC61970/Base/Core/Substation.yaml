name: Substation
description: A collection of equipment for purposes other than generation or utilization, through which electric energy in
  bulk is passed for the purposes of switching or modifying its characteristics.

  sourceDescription: NamingSecondarySubstation
  targetCardinality: The secondary substations that are normally energized from the feeder.  Used for naming purposes.   Should
    be consistent with the other associations for energizing terminal specification and the feeder energization specification.
  targetName: NamingFeeder
  targetDescription: The primary feeder that normally energizes the secondary substation. Used for naming purposes.  Either
    this association or the substation to subgeographical region should be used for hierarchical containment specification.

  sourceDescription: NormalEnergizedSubstation
  targetCardinality: The substations that are normally energized by the feeder.
  targetName: NormalEnergizingFeeder
  targetDescription: The feeders that potentially energize  the downstream substation.  Should be consistent with the associations
    that describe the naming hierarchy.
