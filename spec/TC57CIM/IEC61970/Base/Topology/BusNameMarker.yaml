name: BusNameMarker
description: Used to apply user standard names to TopologicalNodes. Associated with one or more terminals that are normally
  connected with the bus name.    The associated terminals are normally connected by non-retained switches. For a ring bus
  station configuration, all BusbarSection terminals in the ring are typically associated.   For a breaker and a half scheme,
  both BusbarSections would normally be associated.  For a ring bus, all BusbarSections would normally be associated.  For
  a "straight" busbar configuration, normally only the main terminal at the BusbarSection would be associated.
attributes:
- name: priority
  type: Integer
  description: Priority of bus name marker for use as topology bus name.  Use 0 for do not care.  Use 1 for highest priority.  Use
    2 as priority is less than 1 and so on.

  targetName: TopologicalNode
  targetDescription: A user defined topological node that was originally defined in a planning model not yet having topology
    described by ConnectivityNodes. Once ConnectivityNodes has been created they may linked to user defined ToplogicalNdes
    using BusNameMarkers.
