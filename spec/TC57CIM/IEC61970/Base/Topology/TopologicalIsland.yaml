name: TopologicalIsland
description: "An electrically connected subset of the network. Topological islands can change as the current network state\
  \ changes, e.g. due to: \n- disconnect switches or breakers changing state in a SCADA/EMS.\n- manual creation, change or\
  \ deletion of topological nodes in a planning tool.\nOnly energised TopologicalNode-s shall be part of the topological island."

  sourceName: AngleRefTopologicalIsland
  sourceDescription: The island for which the node is an angle reference.   Normally there is one angle reference node for
    each island.
  targetCardinality: 0..1
  targetName: AngleRefTopologicalNode
  targetDescription: The angle reference for the island.   Normally there is one TopologicalNode that is selected as the angle
    reference for each island.   Other reference schemes exist, so the association is typically optional.
