name: ValueAliasSet
description: Describes the translation of a set of values into a name and is intendend to facilitate custom translations.
  Each ValueAliasSet has a name, description etc. A specific Measurement may represent a discrete state like Open, Closed,
  Intermediate etc. This requires a translation from the MeasurementValue.value number to a string, e.g. 0-&gt;"Invalid",
  1-&gt;"Open", 2-&gt;"Closed", 3-&gt;"Intermediate". Each ValueToAlias member in ValueAliasSet.Value describe a mapping for
  one particular value to a name.
