name: Limit
description: Specifies one limit value for a Measurement. A Measurement typically has several limits that are kept together
  by the LimitSet class. The actual meaning and use of a Limit instance (i.e., if it is an alarm or warning limit or if it
  is a high or low limit) is not captured in the Limit class. However the name of a Limit instance may indicate both meaning
  and use.
