name: DiagramObjectPoint
description: A point in a given space defined by 3 coordinates and associated to a diagram object.  The coordinates may be
  positive or negative as the origin does not have to be in the corner of a diagram.
attributes:
- name: sequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: The sequence position of the point, used for defining the order of points for diagram objects acting as a polyline
    or polygon with more than one point. The attribute shall be a positive value.
- name: xPosition
  type: Float
  description: The X coordinate of this point.
- name: yPosition
  type: Float
  description: The Y coordinate of this point.
- name: zPosition
  type: Float
  description: The Z coordinate of this point.
associations:
- source: DiagramObjectPoint
  target: DiagramObjectGluePoint
  sourceCardinality: 2..*
  targetCardinality: 0..1
  sourceName: DiagramObjectPoints
  sourceDescription: A diagram object glue point is associated with 2 or more object points that are considered to be 'glued'
    together.
  targetName: DiagramObjectGluePoint
  targetDescription: The 'glue' point to which this point is associated.
- source: DiagramObjectPoint
  target: DiagramObject
  sourceCardinality: 0..*
  targetCardinality: "1"
  sourceName: DiagramObjectPoints
  sourceDescription: A diagram object can have 0 or more points to reflect its layout position, routing (for polylines) or
    boundary (for polygons).
  targetName: DiagramObject
  targetDescription: The diagram object with which the points are associated.
