name: Diagram
description: The diagram being exchanged. The coordinate system is a standard Cartesian coordinate system and the orientation
  attribute defines the orientation. The initial view related attributes can be used to specify an initial view with the x,y
  coordinates of the diagonal points.
attributes:
- name: orientation
  type: OrientationKind
  description: Coordinate system orientation of the diagram. A positive orientation gives standard “right-hand” orientation,
    with negative orientation indicating a “left-hand” orientation. For 2D diagrams, a positive orientation will result in
    X values increasing from left to right and Y values increasing from bottom to top. A negative orientation gives the “left-hand”
    orientation (favoured by computer graphics displays) with X values increasing from left to right and Y values increasing
    from top to bottom.
- name: x1InitialView
  type: Float
  description: X coordinate of the first corner of the initial view.
- name: x2InitialView
  type: Float
  description: X coordinate of the second corner of the initial view.
- name: y1InitialView
  type: Float
  description: Y coordinate of the first corner of the initial view.
- name: y2InitialView
  type: Float
  description: Y coordinate of the second corner of the initial view.
