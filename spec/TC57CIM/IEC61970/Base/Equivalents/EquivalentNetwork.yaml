name: EquivalentNetwork
description: A class that groups electrical equivalents, including internal nodes, of a network that has been reduced. The
  ConnectivityNodes contained in the equivalent are intended to reflect internal nodes of the equivalent. The boundary Connectivity
  nodes where the equivalent connects outside itself are not contained by the equivalent.
