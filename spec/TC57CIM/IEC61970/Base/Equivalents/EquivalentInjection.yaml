name: EquivalentInjection
description: This class represents equivalent injections (generation or load).  Voltage regulation is allowed only at the
  point of connection.
attributes:
- name: maxP
  type: ActivePower
  description: Maximum active power of the injection.
- name: maxQ
  type: ReactivePower
  description: Maximum reactive power of the injection.  Used for modelling of infeed for load flow exchange. Not used for
    short circuit modelling.  If maxQ and minQ are not used ReactiveCapabilityCurve can be used.
- name: minP
  type: ActivePower
  description: Minimum active power of the injection.
- name: minQ
  type: ReactivePower
  description: Minimum reactive power of the injection.  Used for modelling of infeed for load flow exchange. Not used for
    short circuit modelling.  If maxQ and minQ are not used ReactiveCapabilityCurve can be used.
- name: r
  type: Resistance
  description: |-
    Positive sequence resistance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909).
    Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
- name: r0
  type: Resistance
  description: |-
    Zero sequence resistance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909).
    Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
- name: r2
  type: Resistance
  description: |-
    Negative sequence resistance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909).
    Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
- name: regulationCapability
  type: Boolean
  description: Specifies whether or not the EquivalentInjection has the capability to regulate the local voltage. If true
    the EquivalentInjection can regulate. If false the EquivalentInjection cannot regulate. ReactiveCapabilityCurve can only
    be associated with EquivalentInjection  if the flag is true.
- name: regulationStatus
  type: Boolean
  description: Specifies the regulation status of the EquivalentInjection.  True is regulating.  False is not regulating.
- name: regulationTarget
  type: Voltage
  description: The target voltage for voltage regulation. The attribute shall be a positive value.
- name: x
  type: Reactance
  description: |-
    Positive sequence reactance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909).
    Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
- name: x0
  type: Reactance
  description: |-
    Zero sequence reactance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909).
    Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
- name: x2
  type: Reactance
  description: |-
    Negative sequence reactance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909).
    Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
- name: p
  type: ActivePower
  description: |-
    Equivalent active power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    Starting value for steady state solutions.
- name: q
  type: ReactivePower
  description: |-
    Equivalent reactive power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
