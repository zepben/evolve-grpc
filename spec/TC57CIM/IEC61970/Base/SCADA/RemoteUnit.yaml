name: RemoteUnit
description: A remote unit can be an RTU, IED, substation control system, control centre, etc. The communication with the
  remote unit can be through various standard protocols (e.g. IEC 61870, IEC 61850) or non standard protocols (e.g. DNP, RP570,
  etc.). A remote unit contains remote data points that might be telemetered, collected or calculated. The RemoteUnit class
  inherits PowerSystemResource. The intention is to allow RemoteUnits to have Measurements. These Measurements can be used
  to model unit status as operational, out of service, unit failure, etc.
