name: UnitMultiplier
description: "The unit multipliers defined for the CIM.  When applied to unit symbols, the unit symbol is treated as a derived\
  \ unit. Regardless of the contents of the unit symbol text, the unit symbol shall be treated as if it were a single-character\
  \ unit symbol. Unit symbols should not contain multipliers, and it should be left to the multiplier to define the multiple\
  \ for an entire data type. \n\nFor example, if a unit symbol is \"m2Pers\" and the multiplier is \"k\", then the value is\
  \ k(m**2/s), and the multiplier applies to the entire final value, not to any individual part of the value. This can be\
  \ conceptualized by substituting a derived unit symbol for the unit type. If one imagines that the symbol \"횧\" represents\
  \ the derived unit \"m2Pers\", then applying the multiplier \"k\" can be conceptualized simply as \"k횧\".\n\nFor example,\
  \ the SI unit for mass is \"kg\" and not \"g\".  If the unit symbol is defined as \"kg\", then the multiplier is applied\
  \ to \"kg\" as a whole and does not replace the \"k\" in front of the \"g\". In this case, the multiplier of \"m\" would\
  \ be used with the unit symbol of \"kg\" to represent one gram.  As a text string, this violates the instructions in IEC\
  \ 80000-1. However, because the unit symbol in CIM is treated as a derived unit instead of as an SI unit, it makes more\
  \ sense to conceptualize the \"kg\" as if it were replaced by one of the proposed replacements for the SI mass symbol. If\
  \ one imagines that the \"kg\" were replaced by a symbol \"횧\", then it is easier to conceptualize the multiplier \"m\"\
  \ as creating the proper unit \"m횧\", and not the forbidden unit \"mkg\"."
