description: The type of fault connection among phases.
attributes:
- name: lineToGround
  description: The fault connects the indicated phases to ground. The line to line fault impedance is not used and assumed
    infinite. The full ground impedance is connected between each phase specified in the fault and ground, but not between
    the phases.
- name: lineToLine
  description: The fault connects the specified phases together without a connection to ground. The ground impedance of this
    fault is ignored. The line to line impedance is connected between each of the phases specified in the fault. For example
    three times for a three phase fault, one time for a two phase fault.  A single phase fault should not be specified.
- name: lineToLineToGround
  description: The fault connects the indicated phases to ground and to each other. The line to line impedance is connected
    between each of the phases specified in the fault in a full mesh. For example three times for a three phase fault, one
    time for a two phase fault. A single phase fault should not be specified. The full ground impedance is connected between
    each phase specified in the fault and ground.
- name: lineOpen
  description: The fault is when the conductor path is broken between two terminals. Additional coexisting faults may be required
    if the broken conductor also causes connections to grounds or other lines or phases.
