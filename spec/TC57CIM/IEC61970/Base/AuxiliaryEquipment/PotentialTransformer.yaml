name: PotentialTransformer
description: Instrument transformer (also known as Voltage Transformer) used to measure electrical qualities of the circuit
  that is being protected and/or monitored. Typically used as voltage transducer for the purpose of metering, protection,
  or sometimes auxiliary substation supply. A typical secondary voltage rating would be 120V.
