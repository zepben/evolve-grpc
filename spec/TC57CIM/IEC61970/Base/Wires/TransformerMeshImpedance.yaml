name: TransformerMeshImpedance
description: |-
  Transformer mesh impedance (Delta-model) between transformer ends.
  The typical case is that this class describes the impedance between two transformer ends pair-wise, i.e. the cardinalities at both transformer end associations are 1. However, in cases where two or more transformer ends are modelled the cardinalities are larger than 1.
