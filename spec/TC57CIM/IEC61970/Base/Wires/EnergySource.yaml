name: EnergySource
description: A generic equivalent for an energy supplier on a transmission or distribution voltage level.
attributes:
- name: activePower
  type: ActivePower
  description: |-
    High voltage source active injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    Starting value for steady state solutions.
- name: nominalVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Phase-to-phase nominal voltage.
- name: r
  type: Resistance
  description: Positive sequence Thevenin resistance.
- name: r0
  type: Resistance
  description: Zero sequence Thevenin resistance.
- name: rn
  type: Resistance
  description: Negative sequence Thevenin resistance.
- name: voltageAngle
  type: AngleRadians
  description: Phase angle of a-phase open circuit used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node associated
    with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used as input
    to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
- name: voltageMagnitude
  type: Voltage
  description: Phase-to-phase open circuit voltage magnitude used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node
    associated with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used
    as input to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
- name: x
  type: Reactance
  description: Positive sequence Thevenin reactance.
- name: x0
  type: Reactance
  description: Zero sequence Thevenin reactance.
- name: xn
  type: Reactance
  description: Negative sequence Thevenin reactance.
- name: reactivePower
  type: ReactivePower
  description: |-
    High voltage source reactive injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    Starting value for steady state solutions.
- name: pMin
  type: ActivePower
  description: This is the minimum active power that can be produced by the source. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive
    sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
- name: pMax
  type: ActivePower
  description: This is the maximum active power that can be produced by the source. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive
    sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
