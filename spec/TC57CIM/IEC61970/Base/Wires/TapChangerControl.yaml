name: TapChangerControl
description: Describes behaviour specific to tap changers, e.g. how the voltage at the end of a line varies with the load
  level and compensation of the voltage drop by tap adjustment.
attributes:
- name: limitVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Maximum allowed regulated voltage on the PT secondary, regardless of line drop compensation. Sometimes referred
    to as first-house protection.
- name: lineDropCompensation
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, the line drop compensation is to be applied.
- name: lineDropR
  type: Resistance
  description: Line drop compensator resistance setting for normal (forward) power flow.
- name: lineDropX
  type: Reactance
  description: Line drop compensator reactance setting for normal (forward) power flow.
- name: reverseLineDropR
  type: Resistance
  description: Line drop compensator resistance setting for reverse power flow.
- name: reverseLineDropX
  type: Reactance
  description: Line drop compensator reactance setting for reverse power flow.
