name: NonlinearShuntCompensatorPoint
description: A non linear shunt compensator bank or section admittance value. The number of NonlinearShuntCompenstorPoint
  instances associated with a NonlinearShuntCompensator shall be equal to ShuntCompensator.maximumSections. ShuntCompensator.sections
  shall only be set to one of the NonlinearShuntCompenstorPoint.sectionNumber. There is no interpolation between NonlinearShuntCompenstorPoint-s.
