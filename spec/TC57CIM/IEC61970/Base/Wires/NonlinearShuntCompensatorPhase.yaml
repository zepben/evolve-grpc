name: NonlinearShuntCompensatorPhase
description: A per phase non linear shunt compensator has bank or section admittance values that differ. The attributes g
  and b of the associated NonlinearShuntCompensatorPhasePoint describe the total conductance and admittance of a NonlinearShuntCompensatorPhasePoint
  at a section number specified by NonlinearShuntCompensatorPhasePoint.sectionNumber.
