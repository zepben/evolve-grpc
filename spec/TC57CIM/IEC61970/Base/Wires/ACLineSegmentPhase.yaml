name: ACLineSegmentPhase
description: Represents a single wire of an alternating current line segment.
attributes:
- name: phase
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: The phase connection of the wire at both ends.
- name: sequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: Number designation for this line segment phase. Each line segment phase within a line segment should have a
    unique sequence number. This is useful for unbalanced modelling to bind the mathematical model (PhaseImpedanceData of
    PerLengthPhaseImpedance) with the connectivity model (this class) and the physical model (WirePosition) without tight
    coupling.
