name: StaticVarCompensator
description: |-
  A facility for providing variable and controllable shunt reactive power. The SVC typically consists of a stepdown transformer, filter, thyristor-controlled reactor, and thyristor-switched capacitor arms.

  The SVC may operate in fixed MVar output mode or in voltage control mode. When in voltage control mode, the output of the SVC will be proportional to the deviation of voltage at the controlled bus from the voltage setpoint.  The SVC characteristic slope defines the proportion.  If the voltage at the controlled bus is equal to the voltage setpoint, the SVC MVar output is zero.

  type: Reactance
  description: Inductive reactance at maximum inductive reactive power.  Shall always be negative.
- name: slope
  type: VoltagePerReactivePower
  description: |-
    The characteristics slope of an SVC defines how the reactive power output changes in proportion to the difference between the regulated bus voltage and the voltage setpoint.
    The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
- name: sVCControlMode
  type: SVCControlMode
  description: SVC control mode.
- name: voltageSetPoint
  type: Voltage
  description: The reactive power output of the SVC is proportional to the difference between the voltage at the regulated
    bus and the voltage setpoint.  When the regulated bus voltage is equal to the voltage setpoint, the reactive power output
    is zero.
- name: q
  type: ReactivePower
  description: |-
    Reactive power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    Starting value for a steady state solution.
