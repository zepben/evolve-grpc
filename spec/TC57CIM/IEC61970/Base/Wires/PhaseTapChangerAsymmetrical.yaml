name: PhaseTapChangerAsymmetrical
description: Describes the tap model for an asymmetrical phase shifting transformer in which the difference voltage vector
  adds to the in-phase winding. The out-of-phase winding is the transformer end where the tap changer is located.  The angle
  between the in-phase and out-of-phase windings is named the winding connection angle. The phase shift depends on both the
  difference voltage magnitude and the winding connection angle.
attributes:
- name: windingConnectionAngle
  type: AngleDegrees
  description: The phase angle between the in-phase winding and the out-of -phase winding used for creating phase shift. The
    out-of-phase winding produces what is known as the difference voltage.  Setting this angle to 90 degrees is not the same
    as a symmetrical transformer. The attribute can only be multiples of 30 degrees.  The allowed range is -150 degrees to
    150 degrees excluding 0.
