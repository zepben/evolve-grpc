name: PetersenCoil
description: A variable impedance device normally used to offset line charging during single line faults in an ungrounded
  section of network.
attributes:
- name: mode
  type: PetersenCoilModeKind
  description: The mode of operation of the Petersen coil.
- name: nominalU
  type: Voltage
  description: The nominal voltage for which the coil is designed.
- name: offsetCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: The offset current that the Petersen coil controller is operating from the resonant point.  This is normally
    a fixed amount for which the controller is configured and could be positive or negative.  Typically 0 to 60 A depending
    on voltage and resonance conditions.
- name: positionCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: The control current used to control the Petersen coil also known as the position current.  Typically in the
    range of 20 mA to 200 mA.
- name: xGroundMax
  type: Reactance
  description: The maximum reactance.
- name: xGroundMin
  type: Reactance
  description: The minimum reactance.
- name: xGroundNominal
  type: Reactance
  description: The nominal reactance.  This is the operating point (normally over compensation) that is defined based on the
    resonance point in the healthy network condition.  The impedance is calculated based on nominal voltage divided by position
    current.
