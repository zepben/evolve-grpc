name: SwitchPhase
description: Single phase of a multi-phase switch when its attributes might be different per phase.
attributes:
- name: normalOpen
  type: Boolean
  description: Used in cases when no Measurement for the status value is present. If the SwitchPhase has a status measurement
    the Discrete.normalValue is expected to match with this value.
- name: phaseSide1
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: Phase of this SwitchPhase on the side with terminal sequence number equal to 1. Should be a phase contained
    in that terminal’s phases attribute.
- name: phaseSide2
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: Phase of this SwitchPhase on the side with terminal sequence number equal to 2.  Should be a phase contained
    in that terminal’s Terminal.phases attribute.
- name: closed
  type: Boolean
  description: The attribute tells if the switch is considered closed when used as input to topology processing.
- name: ratedCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: |-
    The maximum continuous current carrying capacity in amps governed by the device material and construction.
    The attribute shall be a positive value.
