name: PhaseTapChangerSymmetrical
description: Describes a symmetrical phase shifting transformer tap model in which the voltage magnitude of both sides is
  the same. The difference voltage magnitude is the base in an equal-sided triangle where the sides corresponds to the primary
  and secondary voltages. The phase angle difference corresponds to the top angle and can be expressed as twice the arctangent
  of half the total difference voltage.
