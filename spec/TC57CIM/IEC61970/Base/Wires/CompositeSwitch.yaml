name: CompositeSwitch
description: "A model of a set of individual Switches normally enclosed within the same cabinet and possibly with interlocks\
  \ that restrict the combination of switch positions. These are typically found in medium voltage distribution networks.\
  \ \nA CompositeSwitch could represent a Ring-Main-Unit (RMU), or pad-mounted switchgear, with primitive internal devices\
  \ such as an internal bus-bar plus 3 or 4 internal switches each of which may individually be open or closed. A CompositeSwitch\
  \ and a set of contained Switches can also be used to represent a multi-position switch e.g. a switch that can connect a\
  \ circuit to Ground, Open or Busbar."
