  sourceDescription: Mutual couplings associated with the branch as the first branch.
  targetName: First_Terminal
  targetDescription: The starting terminal for the calculation of distances along the first branch of the mutual coupling.  Normally
    MutualCoupling would only be used for terminals of AC line segments.  The first and second terminals of a mutual coupling
    should point to different AC line segments.
