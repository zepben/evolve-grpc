name: ExternalNetworkInjection
description: This class represents the external network and it is used for IEC 60909 calculations.
attributes:
- name: governorSCD
  type: ActivePowerPerFrequency
  description: Power Frequency Bias. This is the change in power injection divided by the change in frequency and negated.  A
    positive value of the power frequency bias provides additional power injection upon a drop in frequency.
- name: ikSecond
