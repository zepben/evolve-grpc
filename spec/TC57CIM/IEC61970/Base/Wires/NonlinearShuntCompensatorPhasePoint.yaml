name: NonlinearShuntCompensatorPhasePoint
description: A per phase non linear shunt compensator bank or section admittance value. The number of NonlinearShuntCompenstorPhasePoint
  instances associated with a NonlinearShuntCompensatorPhase shall be equal to ShuntCompensatorPhase.maximumSections. ShuntCompensator.sections
  shall only be set to one of the NonlinearShuntCompenstorPhasePoint.sectionNumber. There is no interpolation between NonlinearShuntCompenstorPhasePoint-s.
