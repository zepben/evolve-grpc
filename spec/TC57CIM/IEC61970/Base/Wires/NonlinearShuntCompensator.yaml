name: NonlinearShuntCompensator
description: A non linear shunt compensator has bank or section admittance values that differ. The attributes g, b, g0 and
  b0 of the associated NonlinearShuntCompensatorPoint describe the total conductance and admittance of a NonlinearShuntCompensatorPoint
  at a section number specified by NonlinearShuntCompensatorPoint.sectionNumber.
