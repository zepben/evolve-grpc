description: "The excitation system model provides the field voltage (<i>Efd</i>) for a synchronous machine model.  It is\
  \ linked to a specific generator (synchronous machine). \nThe representation of all limits used by the models (not including\
  \ IEEE standard models) shall comply with the representation defined in the Annex E of the IEEE 421.5-2005, unless specified\
  \ differently in the documentation of the model.\nThe parameters are different for each excitation system model; the same\
  \ parameter name can have different meaning in different models."
