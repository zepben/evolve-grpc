description: "An asynchronous machine model represents a (induction) generator or motor with no external connection to the\
  \ rotor windings, e.g. a squirrel-cage induction machine. \nThe interconnection with the electrical network equations can\
  \ differ among simulation tools.  The program only needs to know the terminal to which this asynchronous machine is connected\
  \ in order to establish the correct interconnection.  The interconnection with the motorâ€™s equipment could also differ due\
  \ to input and output signals required by standard models.\nThe asynchronous machine model is used to model wind generators\
  \ type 1 and type 2.  For these, normal practice is to include the rotor flux transients and neglect the stator flux transients."
