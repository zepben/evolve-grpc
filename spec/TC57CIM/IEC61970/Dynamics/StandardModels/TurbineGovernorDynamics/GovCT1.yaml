description: "General model for any prime mover with a PID governor, used primarily for combustion turbine and combined cycle\
  \ units.\nThis model can be used to represent a variety of prime movers controlled by PID governors.  It is suitable, for\
  \ example, for the representation of: \n<ul>\n\t<li>gas turbine and single shaft combined cycle turbines</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\
  \t<li>diesel engines with modern electronic or digital governors  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>steam turbines where steam is\
  \ supplied from a large boiler drum or a large header whose pressure is substantially constant over the period under study</li>\n\
  \t<li>simple hydro turbines in dam configurations where the water column length is short and water inertia effects are minimal.</li>\n\
  </ul>\nAdditional information on this model is available in the 2012 IEEE report, <i><u>Dynamic Models for Turbine-Governors\

- name: aset
  type: Float
  description: Acceleration limiter setpoint (<i>Aset</i>).  Unit = PU / s.  Typical value = 0,01.
- name: db
  type: PU
  description: Speed governor deadband in PU speed (<i>db</i>).  In the majority of applications, it is recommended that this
    value be set to zero.  Typical value = 0.
- name: dm
  type: PU
  description: Speed sensitivity coefficient (<i>Dm</i>).  <i>Dm</i> can represent either the variation of the engine power
    with the shaft speed or the variation of maximum power capability with shaft speed.  If it is positive it describes the
    falling slope of the engine speed verses power characteristic as speed increases. A slightly falling characteristic is
    typical for reciprocating engines and some aero-derivative turbines.  If it is negative the engine power is assumed to
    be unaffected by the shaft speed, but the maximum permissible fuel flow is taken to fall with falling shaft speed. This
    is characteristic of single-shaft industrial turbines due to exhaust temperature limits.  Typical value = 0.
