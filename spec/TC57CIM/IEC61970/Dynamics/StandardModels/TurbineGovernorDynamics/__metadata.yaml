description: "The turbine-governor model is linked to one or two synchronous generators and determines the shaft mechanical\
  \ power (<i>Pm</i>) or torque (<i>Tm</i>) for the generator model.  \nUnlike IEEE standard models for other function blocks,\
  \ the three IEEE turbine-governor standard models (GovHydroIEEE0, GovHydroIEEE2, and GovSteamIEEE1) are documented in IEEE\
  \ Transactions, not in IEEE standards. For that reason, diagrams are supplied for those models.\nA 2012 IEEE report, <i><u>Dynamic\
  \ Models for Turbine-Governors in Power System Studies</u></i>, provides updated information on a variety of models including\
  \ IEEE, vendor and reliability authority models.  Fully incorporating the results of that report into the CIM dynamics model\
  \ is a future effort."
