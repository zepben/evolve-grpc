description: |-
  In certain system configurations, continuous excitation control with terminal voltage and power system stabilizing regulator input signals does not ensure that the potential of the excitation system for improving system stability is fully exploited. For these situations, discontinuous excitation control signals can be employed to enhance stability following large transient disturbances.
