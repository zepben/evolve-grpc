name: SynchronousMachineSimplified
description: "The simplified model represents a synchronous generator as a constant internal voltage behind an impedance<i>\
  \ </i>(<i>Rs + jXp</i>) as shown in the Simplified diagram.\nSince internal voltage is held constant, there is no <i>Efd</i>\
  \ input and any excitation system model will be ignored.  There is also no <i>Ifd</i> output.\nThis model should not be\
  \ used for representing a real generator except, perhaps, small generators whose response is insignificant.  \nThe parameters\
  \ used for the simplified model include:\n- RotatingMachineDynamics.damping (<i>D</i>);\n- RotatingMachineDynamics.inertia\
  \ (<i>H</i>);\n- RotatingMachineDynamics.statorLeakageReactance (used to exchange <i>jXp </i>for SynchronousMachineSimplified);\n\
  - RotatingMachineDynamics.statorResistance (<i>Rs</i>)."
