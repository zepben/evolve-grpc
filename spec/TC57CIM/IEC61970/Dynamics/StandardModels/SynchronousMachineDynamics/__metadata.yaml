name: SynchronousMachineDynamics
description: "For conventional power generating units (e.g., thermal, hydro, combustion turbine), a synchronous machine model\
  \ represents the electrical characteristics of the generator and the mechanical characteristics of the turbine-generator\
  \ rotational inertia.  Large industrial motors or groups of similar motors can be represented by individual motor models\
  \ which are represented as generators with negative active power in the static (power flow) data.  \nThe interconnection\
  \ with the electrical network equations can differ among simulation tools.  The tool only needs to know the synchronous\
  \ machine to establish the correct interconnection.  The interconnection with the motorâ€™s equipment could also differ due\
  \ to input and output signals required by standard models."
