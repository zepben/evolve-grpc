description: |-
  Wind turbines are generally divided into four types, which are currently significant in power systems.  The four types have the following characteristics:
  - type 1: wind turbine with directly grid connected asynchronous generator with fixed rotor resistance (typically squirrel cage);
  - type 2: wind turbine with directly grid connected asynchronous generator with variable rotor resistance;
  - type 3: wind turbines with doubly-fed asynchronous generators (directly connected stator and rotor connected through power converter);
  - type 4: wind turbines connected to the grid through a full size power converter.
  Models included in this package are according to IEC 61400-27-1:2015.
