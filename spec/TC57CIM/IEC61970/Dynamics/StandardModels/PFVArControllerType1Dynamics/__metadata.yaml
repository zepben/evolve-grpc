description: |-
  <font color="#0f0f0f">Excitation systems for synchronous machines are sometimes supplied with an optional means of automatically adjusting generator output reactive power (VAr) or power factor (PF) to a user-specified value. This can be accomplished with either a reactive power or power factor controller or regulator.  A reactive power or power factor controller is defined as a PF/VAr controller in IEEE 421.1 as “a control function that acts through the reference adjuster to modify the voltage regulator set point to maintain the synchronous machine steady-state power factor or reactive power at a predetermined value.” </font>
