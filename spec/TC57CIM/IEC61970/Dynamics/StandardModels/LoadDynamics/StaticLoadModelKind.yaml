name: StaticLoadModelKind
description: Type of static load model.
attributes:
- name: exponential
  description: |-
    This model is an exponential representation of the load. Exponential equations for active and reactive power are used and the following attributes are required:
    kp1, kp2, kp3, kpf, ep1, ep2, ep3
    kq1, kq2, kq3, kqf, eq1, eq2, eq3.
- name: zIP1
  description: |-
    This model integrates the frequency-dependent load (primarily motors).  ZIP1 equations for active and reactive power are used and the following attributes are required:
    kp1, kp2, kp3, kpf
    kq1, kq2, kq3, kqf.
- name: zIP2
  description: |-
    This model separates the frequency-dependent load (primarily motors) from other load.  ZIP2 equations for active and reactive power are used and the following attributes are required:
    kp1, kp2, kp3, kq4, kpf
    kq1, kq2, kq3, kq4, kqf.
- name: constantZ
  description: The load is represented as a constant impedance.  ConstantZ equations are used  for active and reactive power
    and no attributes are required.
