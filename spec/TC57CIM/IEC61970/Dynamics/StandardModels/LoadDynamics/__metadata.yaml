description: "Dynamic load models are used to represent the dynamic real and reactive load behaviour of a load from the static\
  \ power flow model.  \nDynamic load models can be defined as applying either to a single load (energy consumer) or to a\
  \ group of energy consumers.  \nLarge industrial motors or groups of similar motors can be represented by a synchronous\
  \ machine model (SynchronousMachineDynamics) or an asynchronous machine model (AsynchronousMachineDynamics), which are usually\
  \ represented as generators with negative active power output in the static (power flow) data."
