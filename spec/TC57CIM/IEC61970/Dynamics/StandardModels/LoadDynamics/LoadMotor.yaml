description: "Aggregate induction motor load. This model is used to represent a fraction of an ordinary load as \"induction\
  \ motor load\".  It allows a load that is treated as an ordinary constant power in power flow analysis to be represented\
  \ by an induction motor in dynamic simulation. This model is intended for representation of aggregations of many motors\
  \ dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but where there is no information on the characteristics of\
  \ individual motors.\nEither a \"one-cage\" or \"two-cage\" model of the induction machine can be modelled. Magnetic saturation\
  \ is not modelled.\nThis model treats a fraction of the constant power part of a load as a motor. During initialisation,\
  \ the initial power drawn by the motor is set equal to <i>Pfrac</i> times the constant <i>P</i> part of the static load.\
  \  The remainder of the load is left as a static load.\nThe reactive power demand of the motor is calculated during initialisation\
  \ as a function of voltage at the load bus. This reactive power demand can be less than or greater than the constant <i>Q</i>\
  \ component of the load.  If the motor's reactive demand is greater than the constant <i>Q</i> component of the load, the\
  \ model inserts a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the motor to bring its reactive demand down to equal the constant <i>Q</i>\
  \ reactive load.  \nIf an induction motor load model and a static load model are both present for a load, the motor <i>Pfrac</i>\
  \ is assumed to be subtracted from the power flow constant <i>P</i> load before the static load model is applied.  The remainder\
  \ of the load, if any, is then represented by the static load model."
