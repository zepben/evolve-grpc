name: AsynchronousMachineUserDefined
description: Asynchronous machine whose dynamic behaviour is described by a user-defined model.
attributes:
- name: proprietary
  type: Boolean
  description: |-
    Behaviour is based on a proprietary model as opposed to a detailed model.
    true = user-defined model is proprietary with behaviour mutually understood by sending and receiving applications and parameters passed as general attributes
    false = user-defined model is explicitly defined in terms of control blocks and their input and output signals.
