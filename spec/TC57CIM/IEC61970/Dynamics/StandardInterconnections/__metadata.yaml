name: StandardInterconnections
description: "This subclause describes the standard interconnections for various types of equipment. These interconnections\
  \ are understood by the application programs and can be identified based on the presence of one of the key classes with\
  \ a relationship to the static power flow model: SynchronousMachineDynamics, AsynchronousMachineDynamics, EnergyConsumerDynamics\
  \ or WindTurbineType3or4Dynamics. \nThe relationships between classes expressed in the interconnection diagrams are intended\
  \ to support dynamic behaviour described by either standard models or user-defined models.\nIn the interconnection diagrams,\
  \ boxes which are black in colour represent function blocks whose functionality can be provided by one of many standard\
  \ models or by a user-defined model. Blue boxes represent specific standard models.  A dashed box means that the function\
  \ block or specific standard model is optional."
