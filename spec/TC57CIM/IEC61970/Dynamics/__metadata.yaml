description: "The CIM dynamic model definitions reflect the most common IEEE or, in the case of wind models, IEC, representations\
  \ of models as well as models included in some of the transient stability software widely used by utilities. \nThese dynamic\
  \ models are intended to ensure interoperability between different vendorsâ€™ software products currently in use by electric\
  \ utility energy companies, utilities, Transmission System Operators (TSOs), Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs),\
  \ and Independent System Operators (ISOs).  It is important to note that each vendor is free to select its own internal\
  \ implementation of these models.  Differences in vendor results, as long as they are within accepted engineering practice,\
  \ caused by different internal representations, are acceptable.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, the following modelling\
  \ conventions are followed:\n- limited integrators are of the non-windup type;\n- it shall be possible to enter a time constant\
  \ of zero (where it makes sense)."
