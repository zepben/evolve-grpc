name: OperatonalLimitTypeScaling
description: One operational limit type scales values of another operational limit type when under the same operational limit
  set.    This applies to any operational limit assigned to the target operational limit type and without other limit dependency
  models.
attributes:
- name: scalingPercent
  type: PerCent
  description: The percentage scaling of the source limit to compute the target limit.  Applys to operational limits within
    an operaitonal limit set when both source and target operational limit types exist.
