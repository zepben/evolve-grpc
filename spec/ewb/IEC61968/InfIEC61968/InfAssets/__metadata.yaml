description: "The package is used to define asset-level models for objects. Assets may be comprised of other assets and may\
  \ have relationships to other assets. Assets also have owners and values. Assets may also have a relationship to a PowerSystemResource\
  \ in the Wires model.\n\nTODO: The following has been copied from a very old version of draft Part 11, so the references\
  \ are wrong, but we store the knowledge here to reuse later:\n\"Assets are the basic units which define a physical infrastructure.\
  \ PowerSystemResources are logical objects meaningful to operations which are constructed from one or more Assets, although\
  \ PowerSystemResources are not required to specifiy their component Assets.\nThe Asset package is comprosed of several packages.\
  \ The key concepts of an Asset are as follows:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Assets can have names, through inheritance to the Naming package</li>\n\
  \t<li>Assets are physical entities which have a lifecycle</li>\n\t<li>One or more assets can be associated to create a PowerSystemResource</li>\n\
  \t<li>Assets can be grouped (aggregated) with other Assets</li>\n\t<li>Assets are typically either 'point' or 'linear' assets,\
  \ which relate to physical geometry</li>\n\t<li>Assets have a close relationship to Work as a consequence of their lifecycle</li>\n\
  </ul>\nThe following sections describe the packages in the Assets package.\nThe AssetBasics package defines the relationship\
  \ between Asset and other classes, such as Organization, PowerSystemResource and Document.\nPoint assets are those assets\
  \ whose physical location can be described in terms of a single coordinate, such as a pole or a switch.\nLinear assets are\
  \ those assets whose physical location is best described in terms of a line, plyline or polygon.\nAsset work triggers are\
  \ used to determine when inspection and/or maintenance are required for assets\"."
