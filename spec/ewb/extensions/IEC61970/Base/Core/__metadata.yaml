name: Core
description: Contains the core PowerSystemResource and ConductingEquipment entities shared by all applications plus common
  collections of those entities. Not all applications require all the Core entities.  This package does not depend on any
  other package except the Domain package, but most of the other packages have associations and generalizations that depend
  on it.
