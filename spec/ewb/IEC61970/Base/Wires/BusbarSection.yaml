name: BusbarSection
description: "A conductor, or group of conductors, with negligible impedance, that serve to connect other conducting equipment\
  \ within a single substation. \nVoltage measurements are typically obtained from voltage transformers that are connected\
  \ to busbar sections. A bus bar section may have many physical terminals but for analysis is modelled with exactly one logical\
  \ terminal."
