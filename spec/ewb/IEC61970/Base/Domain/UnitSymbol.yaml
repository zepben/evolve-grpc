name: UnitSymbol
description: "The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the derived unit is equal to an SI unit. Whenever\
  \ possible, the standard derived symbol is used instead of the formula for the derived unit. For example, the unit symbol\
  \ Farad is defined as \"F\" instead of \"CPerV\". In cases where a standard symbol does not exist for a derived unit, the\
  \ formula for the unit is used as the unit symbol. For example, density does not have a standard symbol and so it is represented\
  \ as \"kgPerm3\". With the exception of the \"kg\", which is an SI unit, the unit symbols do not contain multipliers and\
  \ therefore represent the base derived unit to which a multiplier can be applied as a whole. \nEvery unit symbol is treated\
  \ as an unparseable text as if it were a single-letter symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined by the accompanying\
  \ descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit symbol.\nTo allow the widest possible range of serializations\
  \ without requiring special character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate from the format described in\
  \ IEC 80000-1. The division symbol \"/\" is replaced by the letters \"Per\". Exponents are written in plain text after the\
  \ unit as \"m3\" instead of being formatted as \"m\" with a superscript of 3  or introducing a symbol as in \"m^3\". The\
  \ degree symbol \"°\" is replaced with the letters \"deg\". Any clarification of the meaning for a substitution is included\
  \ in the description for the unit symbol.\nNon-SI units are included in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data to\
  \ be correctly labelled with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor that is reporting numbers that represent feet\
  \ instead of meters). This allows software to use the unit symbol information correctly convert and scale the raw data of\
  \ those sources into SI-based units. \nThe integer values are used for harmonization with IEC 61850."
